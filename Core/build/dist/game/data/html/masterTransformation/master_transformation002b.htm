<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br1>
After you have been guided through the process of transformation by a wizard, you may transform yourself into another shape by bringing a transform sealbook to me.<br1>
Know that it is no easy task to earn one. I have heard, however, that you may find one through the Marketeer of Mammon or the Adventure Guild.<br1>
