<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Pochi:<br1>
Welcome! Do you want to deposit some of your items? Or perhaps reclaim some of them? Well, well. Have you been to the shop near here which sells only the finest luxury goods? If you haven't yet, you should. Dwarf Galladucci, a member of my clan, runs the shop. He may seem a little eccentric, but he really has an eye for quality. Go see for yourself!<br1>
