<html><body>Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:<br1>
Woooo!  I'm a ghost page of the ancient Elmoreden Empire!  I worked in the cemetery when I was a mortal being. Now I'm here to help travelers going to the Elmoreden Cemetery.<br1>
My boss is in the Pilgrim's Necropolis. He also helps people visit the cemetery.<br1>
Would you like to visit the cemetery of the Elmoreden empire?  <br1>
