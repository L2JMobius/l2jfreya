Reed Field of Innadril should not be visited if you are not <font color="LEVEL">"above Level 83"</font>! <br1>
It's very complicated in various aspects. For example, a bunch of Mucrokians, a part of Crokian Faction, have appeared from nowhere and occupied the Reed Field; a strange Dwarf called Dr. Helvetica is threatening to wipe out the Reed Field; and torches are lighted and the power of spirits are gathering in the southern Reed Field in order to reclaim the old whispers and quietness of the Reed Field.<br1>
Also, Mucrokians are strong! They seem to be a bit weaker against magic...<br1>
and there are people who had such a strange experience as if being possessed by a ghost by drinking suspicious medicine rarely dropped by them...!<br1>
Anyway, head to Field of Silence to meet that charismatic Dr. Helvetica, and to Field of Whisper to meet an Elf performing Natural Regression Movement!<br1>
