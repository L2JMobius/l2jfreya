Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">"level 81 or higher"</font>, the vengeful spirits of the chieftains that slept within the Burial Grounds of Disgrace were freed when Varangka in the Den of Evil gained Kasha's power and revived them and their followers using Kasha's power.<br1>
There are many of them now, so if you go be sure to do so in a powerful group.<br1>
In fact, the Grave Robbers who used to run rampant through the place are now too frightened to even leave their hideout! At least that's one less thing to worry about...<br1>
