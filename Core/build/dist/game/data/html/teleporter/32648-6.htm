Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">"level 76 or higher"</font>, the lower level of the Forge of the Gods recently experienced a rapid rise in temperature, which caused some changes to the creatures in the area.<br1>
The creatures most affected were the Lavasaurus and Tar Beetle. Lavasaurus adults cannot be found, but the eggs buried in the area became very sensitive to nearby activity. If they sense any significant sounds or vibrations, they will suddenly hatch and attack. It is rumored that an Ancient Lavasaurus also hides somewhere in the area.<br1>
The other creature, the Tar Beetle, also recently appeared. It's not particularly menacing, but it spits out a sticky black mucus when threatened. <br1>
Finally, Golems that used to be spread throughout the region have now concentrated in one place. We don't know why.<br1>
