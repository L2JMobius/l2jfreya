Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">"level 80 or higher"</font>, the Chamber of Delusion is a new dimension discovered by the Pathfinders who studied Kamaroka. <br1>
Existing in dreamspace, it is reputed to be a place filled with monsters born of nightmares and chaos, commannded by Aenkinel, the Invader of Dreams.<br1>
Since the Chamber of Delusion does not physically exist in our world, you can only move there with the help of a <font color="LEVEL">"Pathfinder"</font>. <br1>
Pathfinders are located in every village, so you should be able to easily find one.<br1>
