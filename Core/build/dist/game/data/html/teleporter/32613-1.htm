<html><body>Game Manager Handy:<br1>
Handy's block checker is a game where the team <font color="LEVEL">"who checks the most blocks in the arena within the 5-minute time limit wins."</font><br1>
When you enter the game, you automatically change into the <font color="LEVEL">"Block Checker"</font>'s shape! If you hit the blocks with the block checker's hammer...<br1>
Boom! The blocks' colors change! The team with the most checked blocks -- blocks whose color has been changed -- wins!<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"When the game begins, all current supplemental magic will be automatically removed! No new supplement magic can be cast, even if the game ends."</font><br1>
