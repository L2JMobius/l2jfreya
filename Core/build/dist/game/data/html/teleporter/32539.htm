You sense an icy cold gaze fixed on you from a gigantic structure that seems somehow not quite alive nor dead.<br1>
The only way to enter the <font color="LEVEL">"heart of the Seed of Infinity"</font> is to pass this Judgment of Silence, which can freeze even the bravest soul. If you are weak and avoid the gaze, you will be <font color="LEVEL">"expelled from the Seed of Infinity."</font><br1>
