Period 4 February<br1>
I heard an infernal racket outside today, and sent out a Probe Golem to investigate... It was those disgusting Dwarves again!<br1>
I'll wager those adena-grubbing dogs are drooling all over the Northern Mine. If it's not one thing it's another!<br1>

Not only the Gray Pillar, but the Collectors and the Bronze Key are here! I heard some Dwarves knocking on the walls trying to find a way in...<br1>
It's only a matter of time until I'm discovered.<br1>
