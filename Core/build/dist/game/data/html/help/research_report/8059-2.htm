Period 3 June<br1>
I was able to seal the crack in the wall to keep out the cold. Of course, if I sealed it permanently, I couldn't get back out, so I fashioned a sort of door.<br1>
Leave it to me, the genius maestro, Chaos, to come up with a solution! Bwa ha ha!<br1>
I think I could really get comfortable here! The plants are incredible!<br1>
I should at least stay here until the weather warms up! <br1>
