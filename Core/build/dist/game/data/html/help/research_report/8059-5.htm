I've finally gotten it to output some energy, but it just won't work properly.<br1>
I theorized that the tower in the middle of the room was some sort of control device.  I connected the Golem to the tower and it immediately began to output some strange sort of data. <font color="LEVEL">"W.D.L."</font>?   Could this be some sort of recognition code?<br1>
