Period 3 August<br1>
I found a very strange Golem while scavenging for fuel today.<br1>
This Golem seemed strangely familiar, and was quite different from the Gatekeeper.<br1>
I think this Golem was... ...a mechanical pet, what was its name, that giant...<br1>
I'll disassemble it later.<br1>I just can't get its damned face out of my mind!<br1>
