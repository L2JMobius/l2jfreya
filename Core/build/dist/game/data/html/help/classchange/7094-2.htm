<html><body>Record of the Guardian of the Mother Tree:<br1>
Panacea was a product of just such a guardian's ritual. He trained long and hard in martial arts techniques that allowed him to block all distractions from his mind.<br1>
However, the ritual is impenetrable in only one aspect, and leaves another aspect quite vulnerable. Elven defenses can be overcome by psychological attacks such as Hate, but beware the guardian's swordsmanship.<br1>
The very fact that he was selected as a guardian of the Mother Tree is evidence of his superiority.<br1>
Use skills such as Ultimate Defense against him.</body></html>
