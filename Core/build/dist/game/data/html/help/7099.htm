<html><body>Khavatari Spirit Spellbook:<br1>
You who follow the path of Khavatari, fear Ajirua!<br1>
The teachings of Khavatari are purely logical. Wind stokes and douses fire, and delivers it to the surface of the body.<br1>
Fire creates tremendous energy in the body, and allows learning of the powerful techniques of Khavatari. But this method uses the power of Ajirua rather than Paagrio. Be careful!<br1>
