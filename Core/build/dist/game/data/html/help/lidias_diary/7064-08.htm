<html><body>Lidia's Diary:<br1>
The Darkness of Abyss<br1>
The starlight is reflected in his smile.<br1>
He speaks of courage, but I don't know where or even who I am!<br1>
Can a crazy person have courage?
Who knows?<br1>
His laughter rings out, and again the word, courage.
The are other words, but they're in an otherworldly language I don't understand.<br1>
The Dark Mage with his dark smile speaks softly to me, holding my hand in the dark night.<br1>
Courage.
Courage.
Courage.
Nothing else matters.<br1>
My ceremony is still going on!
What brings you here so late?<br1>
