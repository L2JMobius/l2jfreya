Smelting means imbuing a weapon or accessory with different energy. Previously, that could only be done using Soul Crystals. But this is a simpler, if riskier, method.<br1>
Recently, a new ore was discovered. It is called the <font color="LEVEL">"Life Stone"</font>, and it possesses very similar characteristics to Soul Crystals. Bring me a Life Stone, a weapon and a few other necessities, and I will smelt the weapon again by infusing it with the Life Stone.<br1>
Unfortunately, we can't accurately predict what kind of power may be conferred on the weapon. Moreover, only the owner of the weapon will be able to use the enhanced abilities. Any weapon that rates higher than the wielder's skill will not display the effect of smelting.<br1>
Finally, it is possible to restore weapons smelted with a Life Stone back to their original state, but it is an expensive process to do so.<br1>
Now, would you like to try smelting?<br1>
