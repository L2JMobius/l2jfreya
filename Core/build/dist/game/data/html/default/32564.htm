<html><body>Magister Papiku:<br1>
Bam ba bam ba bah! I'm the singing magister, Papiku!<br1>
Why am I in a good mood? Well, the passage to Gracia -- which had been blocked for hundreds of years -- has finally been opened!<br1>
That's good, since the Gracian people desperately need our help. And we can have the use of the fabled <font color="LEVEL">"ship that sails on a sea of stars"</font>, which we believed had been lost forever. Imagine how much our understanding of magic will benefit from this!<br1>
