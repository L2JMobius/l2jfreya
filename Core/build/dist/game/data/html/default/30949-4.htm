It permits teleportation between the floors of the tower. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but through much trial and error I have determined how to go to the first, fifth and tenth floor.<br1>
To go to the <font color="LEVEL">"fifth floor"</font>, you need a <font color="LEVEL">"Blue Dimension Stone"</font>.<br1>
These are quite rare... At great personal cost I was able to secure a small box of them, but Hallate and his minions stole them away... Now they can only be obtained by killing those demons... <br1>
