<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br1>
Our guild is the largest and most powerful of the six guilds that define Dwarven society. We boast of a tradition of nearly one thousand years as a prestigious union of famous traders and powerful bankers. Our guild runs warehouses in almost every city of the continent.<br1>
We do not pay heed to the boundaries drawn by Humans! Wherever there are customers -- from the snowy fields of Lansk to the faraway land of Kandeef across the ocean -- we do business with all who want to trade! That is the spirit of independence embodied by our Iron Gate Guild.<br1>
