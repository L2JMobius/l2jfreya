Tejakar Oroka! I am Toruku. I teach Kabart, the Orcs' martial art. Kabart is a martial art that trains your body to become a deadly weapon. Orcs that train in this do not depend on common weapons such as swords or spears, but learn combat skills that involve only swift movements and precise blows.<br1>
Paagrio of the flame teaches that we must continuously strive to strengthen ourselves to become stronger than all life which has breath. I have broken ties with the world and come to this isolated wasteland to fulfill these teachings and concentrate on the further training of Kabart.<br1>
