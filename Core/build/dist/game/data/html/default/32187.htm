I heard the sound of your stamping feet before, haven't I? This is the holy altar of Nornil? Keep quiet and show reverence! <br1>
Do you intend to enter <font color="LEVEL">"Nornil's Cave"</font>? Then be warned. It is the birthplace of most of the monsters on the Isle of Souls. Many Kamael have entered through the years; few have ever emerged. <br1>
You have chosen a thorny path indeed... <br1>
