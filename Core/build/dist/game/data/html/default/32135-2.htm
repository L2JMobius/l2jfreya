From now on, you must pay more attention!
Listen to me carefully: the most important thing
for you to have is the will to seek adventure in
 the depest parts of the Isle of Souls. Follow that

Ah, one last thing! When you reach level 10, visit
 <font color="LEVEL">"Hierarch Kekropus"</font> and he will tell you of the test
 you must take to become a true Kameal warrior.<br1>
