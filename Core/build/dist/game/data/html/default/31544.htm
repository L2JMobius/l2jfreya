Have you heard about the beast that lurks in the hot springs area?<br1>
Icicle Emperor Bumbalump, also known as the king of the yetis!<br1>
It's said that he eats people alive!<br1>
How gruesome.<br1>
He's a voracious eater, and can put away a family in one sitting!<br1>
I don't know why nobody has killed him yet!<br1>
