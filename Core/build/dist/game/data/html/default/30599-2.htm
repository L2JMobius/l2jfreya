Consider where you wish to finish, and that will tell you where to start. The Kingdom of Aden is in chaos, because they are at war with Elmore, and with Gracia across the sea. What better time will there be to restore the Elven people to their ancient greatness?<br1>

Begin your training by hunting<font color="LEVEL">" red keltirs"</font> or wolves near the village. Be cautious, particularly with the wolves, for they are very savage.
