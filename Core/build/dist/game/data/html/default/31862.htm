<html><body>Angelic Vortex:<br1>
The Angelic Vortex emits a faint light, and in the midst of the light an image appears. In the deepest part of a specious area, a gigantic stone statue is visible. The statue has a human-like appearance and is in a seated position, as though it was being held by some invisible force against its will.<br1>
