<html><body>Sir Aron Tanford:<br1>
This road is a trade way between Gludin and Giran Harbor. My job is to protect the travelers and merchants from the Orcs and Lizardmen.<br1>
Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. My name is Aron Tanford, and I am the watchman of the Wastelands. I stop the brutes here from breaking out of their places and threatening the village people.<br1>
