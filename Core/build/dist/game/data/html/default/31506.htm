<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br1>
I exist to guard this world.<br1>
You're fighting to get the power of the seal, aren't you? Do you have any idea of the peril you're putting us in? You probably don't know this, but the seal has been broken before! It opened a dimension gap, through which escaped terrible demons from the depths of hell! The few who are aware of this terrible danger have managed to forestall the invasion thus far...<br1>
...But our forces are over-stretched! Will you join our fight against this ghastly threat?<br1>
