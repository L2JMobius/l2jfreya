<html><body>Foreman Laferon:<br1>
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Laferon, and I'm foreman of this strip mine. We keep our Dwarves working day and night here. Most of our crew here are young Dwarves, here to learn our people's ways. Diligence, that's the thing. It's why Dwarves control the economy of the continent.<br1>
