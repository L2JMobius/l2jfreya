Strange things have been happening to me lately... When I wake up I find scars I don't remember getting... Things broken I don't remember breaking...<br1>
I wonder... could I be  sleepwalking? I don't remember a thing!... <br1>
Oh, hello, traveler! Sorry to tell you this, but there's no place to stay in this village! Violet over there is selling some odd items, but other than that... this is, well, a ghost town!<br1>
If only I could... Sigh...! I just want to leave here and run away to Rune Castle Town! <br1>
Oh, was I talking out loud? Where could I possibly go? I couldn't leave this land! My ancestors have lived here for generations!<br1>
