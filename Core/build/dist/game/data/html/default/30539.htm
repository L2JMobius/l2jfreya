<html><body>Priestess of the Earth Chichirin:<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Carna Maphr!"</font> May the blessing of the Goddess of the Earth be with you.<br1>
The venerated <font color="LEVEL">"Hero Lucien"</font> had enormous strength and willpower when he fought against the wicked <font color="LEVEL">"Earth Wyrm Trasken,"</font> saving us Dwarves from the evil creature. Lucien once said, "I, Lucien, have always believed that the Goddess of the Earth is forever with me. Today s victory was only possible because of the blessing of the Goddess of the Earth!" What a wise remark!<br1>
We can learn a valuable lesson from Lucien, only those who truly believe in the Goddess's bounty will find what they seek!<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Carna Maphr,"</font> I'm sure that you too will be blessed if you keep true to your faith.<br1>
