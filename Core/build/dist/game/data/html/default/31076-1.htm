<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br1>
A class transfer permits a character who has reached a certain level of experience and ability to acquire a new, higher-level occupation.<br1>
In order to complete the class transfer, you must undertake a <font color="LEVEL">"Class Change Quest"</font>. Only characters who are at least level 19 may perform this quest; the class transfer takes effect once the quest is completed and the character reaches level 20. Choose your new occupation wisely, because you cannot undue it once the class transfer is completed.<br1>
To hear detailed information about where you can receive a Class Transfer Quest, which occupations you can choose, and more, you should speak to the appropriate Grand Master.<br1>
