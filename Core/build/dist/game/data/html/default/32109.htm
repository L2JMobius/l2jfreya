<html><body>Stone Statue of Shilen:<br1>
(The statue is worn in places by wind and rain -- proof that it has stood guard here a long, long time. Despite its weatherbeaten appearance, it feels somehow dignified and majestic. Standing before it, you sense a presence.)<br1>
You, outsider... Why have you come here to this statue? For I am Mother Shilen's avatar and the last guard of Sailren!<br1>
