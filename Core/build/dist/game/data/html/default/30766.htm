Behold, you who are casting threads from the top of the tower while being blown by the wind. I am in possession of the sword that cuts time. In front of me everything is vanity& Everything is in vain...<br1>
I am the North Star that is nailed to the night sky and I am a guide post that has been thrown into the current of time and space.<br1>
