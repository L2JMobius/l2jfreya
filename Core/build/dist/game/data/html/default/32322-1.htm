We will sell the items, many of them precious or hard-to-find, only at the time of the auction, which will be announced in advance.<br1>
Once items are registered, they will auctioned off to the highest bidder.<br1>
All non-winning bidders will receive a refund in the exact amount of the money they unsucessfully bid on an item. The highest bidder will receive the item (at the cost specified).<br1>
Ah...you were outbid. Please note your refund and proceed with next bid. If there is a passed-in price, the auction will stop.<br1>
After the auction ends, the highest bidder can obtain his or her new items at the warehouse.<br1>
If the passed-in amount is not redeemed within one week, we will keep the amount. A long-term deposit is impossible due to the large number of customers.<br1>
Remember: items are non-returnable, so make your selection carefully!
