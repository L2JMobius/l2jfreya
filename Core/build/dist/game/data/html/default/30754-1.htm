... The Heart of Warding is a doorway that was made by those who imprisoned Antharas... A <font color="LEVEL">"Portal Stone"</font> activates it. <font color="LEVEL">"Antharas Watchman Theodric"</font> distributes Portal stones to those who have been approved by the seal watchmen.<br1>
If you wish to obtain a Portal Stone, you should go and see Gabrielle. Gain her approval and then come back to see me...<br1>
