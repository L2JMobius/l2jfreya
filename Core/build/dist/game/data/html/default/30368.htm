By chance, do you have a <font color="LEVEL">"lover?"</font> If you do, then send a letter filled with your love right now. It is no use regretting something when time has passed. When I search my memory, I can see him clearly... A long time -- so long that Humans cannot even imagine -- has passed. But still, I am happy. I have kept my promise to him, and I have my memories.<br1>
