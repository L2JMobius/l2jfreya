Many people are unnecessarily frightened of Necromancers. Humans have an irrational fear of blood and that seems to drive their prejudice. Basicaly, a Necromancer is just a person who studies the lives of humans and other living beings. This knowledge was passed down from the time of the Titans.<br1>
there are two types of necromancy: Healing and ressurection.<br1>
If you want to learn about necromancy, you have come to the right place. Good luck!<br1>
