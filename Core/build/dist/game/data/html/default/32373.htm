Welcome! I have waited for you for so long... I must tell you that there is a strong magical barrier surrounding Steel Citadel. 
If any non-devil attempts to enter the tower, the barrier will activate, breaking everything in its field into pieces. 
Fortunately, I know how to circumvent that magic. Do you wish my help?<br1>
