<html><body>Researcher Keplon:<br1>
Such arrogance! Young people these days...tsk tsk... anyway...<br1>
I am a researcher from the Gray Pillar Guild, sent to study the Tower of Insolence. It is considered the greatest architectural achievement of all time. There are many secrets here yet to be revealed. <br1>
If you are going to ignore my advice and stay here, I would like to ask you for a favor: When I came to this place I was accompanied by two other researchers... While they were investigating the <font color="LEVEL">"dimension vortex"</font> they vanished! If you find them please tell them that if they want to reach the <font color="LEVEL">"10th floor"</font> they should use a <font color="LEVEL">"Red Dimension Stone"</font>...<br1>
