<html><body>Khavatari Rosheek:<br1>
What brings you to this desolate snowfield, young traveler? I am Rosheek, who trains Kabart, the traditional martial art of the Orcs.<br1>
As the god Paagrio has taught us, we must continuously make an effort to strengthen ourselves above all the other creatures that live. I have stayed in this place for the past month, fasting and meditating, to discipline myself in order to reach a higher level of strength.<br1>
When my mind concentrates to fight the severe cold and hunger, I can feel the heat of the combative spirit that burns like a flame within me. How would you like to meditate here with me?<br1>
