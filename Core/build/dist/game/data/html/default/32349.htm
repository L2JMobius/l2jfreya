Welcome, welcome! I am Rignos. Parme and I are old friends, so I've come here to help. It's been a long time since I've traveled this far, but the beautiful Isle of Prayer always makes me feel like I'm on vacation. Now then, how can I help? A race! You know what I always say, "Joy and energy, all the time and in every way!" I call it the <font color="LEVEL">"Grand Isle of Prayer Race"</font>!<br1>
You do know what this means, don't you?<br1>
