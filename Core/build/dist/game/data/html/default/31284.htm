<html><body>Spellbook Seller Elena:<br1>
Welcome! I deal in old books and spellbooks. Books are a reservoir of civilization, don't you think? Without them, the world would revert into a primitive, savage place. I don't even want to imagine it!<br1>
So many books were burned during the persecutions during the last years of the empire. The idea of burning a book just because you don't agree with what it says... Oh, I get angry just thinking of it!<br1>
Of course, now it's possible to learn magic without spellbooks, so I am not sure how much longer we will be needed. If that happens, I guess I'll have to look for a librarian job at the Ivory Tower or Library of Rune.<br1>
