<html><body>Collector Marsha:<br1>
My older brother Trumpin is also a collector. He is very diligent and capable, although he does have a weakness for games of chance. I have watched him gamble away all his savings.<br1>
Actually I saw him not too long ago. We were running away from monster eyes and became separated. He must still be somewhere in this crater...<br1>
