The power of pigments is a double-edged sword. If you want to be more powerful, you must make certain...sacrifices. But for a must-have item, it's probably worth it, eh?<br1>
I guarantee the quality of these pigments here. After all, I am the most trusted pigment trader in the entire kingdom...<br1>
