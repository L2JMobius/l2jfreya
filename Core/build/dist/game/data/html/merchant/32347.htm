<html><body>Shadai:<br1>
Greetings, traveler! I am Shadai of Hellbound, the legendary Dwarven blacksmith. Ah, I know I may look a bit shabby, but you mustn't judge a sword by its sheath! Ha ha ha! You are a lucky fellow, my friend, to have bumped into me. Interested in turning that luck into wealth? I'll make you a deal: if you get me an item I need, I'll use my skills to craft you something.<br1>
