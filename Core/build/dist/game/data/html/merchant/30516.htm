<html><body>Weapon Merchant Reep:<br1>
Welcome, customer! I am Reep, the manager of this branch of the Golden Wheel guild.<br1>
Remember, the price of armor and weapons doesn't always reflect their quality. Am I saying that it doesn't matter? Of course not! But you should judge them independently of the cost.<br1>
For someone like you, that shouldn't be a problem.<br1>
