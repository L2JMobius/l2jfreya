<html><body>Spellbook Seller Burns:<br1>
Welcome! I'm Burns! I sell spellbooks.<br1>
Ha! It must seem strange to see a specialized book seller like me in a small village like this! Hunters Village may be remote, but it's hard to find a place where you can experience the magic of nature like this! Mystics can be found wherever you travel in this world. So is it so strange to find people like me who cater to them?<br1>
What kind of spellbooks are you interested in?<br1>
