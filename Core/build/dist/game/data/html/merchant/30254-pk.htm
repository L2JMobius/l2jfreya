Oh! Oh! Oh! I am so pleased to meet you! Aren't you the famous fugitive that has the whole village gossiping? How did you fool the guards? I can't believe I'm seeing you in person. Hmm ... What should I ask you first?<br1>Just why are the village guards looking for you anyway? You punished the bad lords and helped the poor people, right? Isn't that it? Have I been reading too many stories?<br1>
