For the eternal glory of the Flame! Child of the Flame, how are you?<br1>
I am Kunai, a weapons trader. I guarantee that our Dwarven-made products are of the best quality. Those stinking Dwarves should be stomped back into their caves, but we can't deny that they make good weapons, eh? Ha ha! Go ahead and have a look around. You won't regret it!<br1>
