<html><body>Merchant Zenkin:<br1>
Come on in, customer! Welcome to the most honest shop in northern Aden.<br1>
There are people spreading nonsense that I, Zenkin, am a wanted criminal from Elmore or a disguised Timak Orc. Can you believe those lunatics? Well, you look like you can tell a hawk from a handsaw, so I trust you won't believe such ridiculous tales.<br1>
Anyway, have a look around. Let me know if you see anything you like, eh?<br1>
