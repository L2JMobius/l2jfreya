I've got to reorganize the entire collection of books in the warehouse and proofread for any typos! What a day! Oh yeah, I also need to bind some books as well! Phew! I'm overwhelmed!<br1>
Hi! Are you looking for a book? I'm very busy right now. Why don't you look around and see if we have something you want? Thanks!<br1>
