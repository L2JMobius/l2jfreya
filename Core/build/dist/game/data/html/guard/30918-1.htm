Reeds have taken over the marshland in recent years. So much so that it is no longer called Innadril Mashland. Now it is known as the Field of Reeds. This road will take you to the <font color="LEVEL">"Field of Whispers"</font>. Further north you will find the <font color="LEVEL">"Field of Silence"</font>.<br1>
They say the reeds there hold their breaths at the arrival of the new goddess.<br1>
