Greetings, are you going hunting in Enchanted Valley? If you are, just follow the path in front of you. Many people come and go to the Enchanted Valley, you can follow them. The valley's entrance looks like a waterfall and if you go in, it is connected to the inner part of the valley.<br1>
Byron over there is a local so he knows a lot about the valley. He says its a rather beautiful place, but dangerous creatures live there.<br1>
