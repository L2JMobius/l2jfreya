The volcanic region in the northeastern part of Goddard is known as the gods' cauldron. It's said that rivers of lava flow there! I don't think it's a place you'd want to spend your vacation!<br1>
Someone else told me that Bigfoot was seen there, too! Getting into a UFO! Are you listening to me? This is important stuff!<br1>
