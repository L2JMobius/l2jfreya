Well now, aren t you a suspicious fellow! How did you come to be here? Where are you from? You have a peculiar accent. Are you by any chance a spy that crossed the border from Elmore?!<br1>
More than Goddard, people coming from Rune or Lansk have been causing a lot of trouble& Once some spies from Rune were roaming around as brigands in this area causing a lot of havoc& Are you& by any chance one of them& ?<br1>
& Hmm! You don t look like one of them. You may go now!<br1>
