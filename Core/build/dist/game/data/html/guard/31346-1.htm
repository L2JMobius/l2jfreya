Well, let's see.. My hometown is in ruins! And now, vicious beasts are trying to kill me every time I turn around... You'd be grumpy too!<br1>
My hometown was a small, peaceful village in the manor ruled by the von Hellmann family. It was an humble village, inhabited by hunters and lumberjacks. The people there were drawn into the revolt and killed, including my entire family...<br1>
I'd prefer that the village had burnt to the ground, but still it exists... A wicked shell of its former self, inhabited only by evil spirits and ghosts. Never go there after dark!<br1>
