<html><body>Guard Bret:<br1>
Having the border so close to the capital city makes me very nervous. Things have quited down now, but if Elmore were tp attack I fear that the border guards would not be able to resist at all. There was talk for a while of opening the border entirely, but now they seem to be on a higher level of alert than ever before. I pray that nothing triggers the resumption of hostilities...<br1>
