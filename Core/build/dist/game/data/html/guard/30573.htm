<html><body>Flame Guardian Vulkus:<br1>
It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Paagrio Guardian Vulkus in the Temple of Paagrio. Orcs once ruled the world and all its races, but now we live on the plateau, because of the power of the Humans.<br1>
Yet it is inevitable that the Orcs will rise again, just as it is inevitable that the everlasting flame of Paagrio will continue to burn.<br1>
