What do you know about Gludio Castle? It is the official residence of the lord of Gludio, of course.<br1>
But it was originally built by wise King Cadmus to deter an invasion from Gracia.<br1>
When Gracia finally did invade a few years ago, the Gludio garrison was safe and secure in the castle, and our troops were able to repel the invaders. All thanks to the king's foresight!<br1>
