<html><body>Guard Moretti:<br1>
Greetings! You may think it is boring to stand guard here all day, but it is always enjoyable having a word or two with travelers. Especially when I stand guard here at the west gate, I frequently meet the Elves from the <font color="LEVEL">"Elven Forest."</font> I m used to it now, but I was really fascinated the first time I saw an Elf...<br1>
