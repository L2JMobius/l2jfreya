I myself have never been to the Bazaar of Giran. However, our village frequently trades with the Bazaar, so I know a little about what it is like there. It is a place where there are all sorts of priceless items. If you can't find it there, then you won't be able to find it anywhere in Aden. It's an enjoyable, lively village. If I have the chance, I should like to go someday.<br1>
