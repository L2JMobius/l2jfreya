<html><body>Guard Johnstone:<br1>
Since I was young, I have idolized Mystics and wanted to study at<font color="LEVEL">" Einhovant's School of Wizardry,"</font> but unfortunately the teachers there told me I had no magical talent.<br1>
Now I realize that my physical strength is where my true gifts lie. In the end, I ve become a guard, and I don t regret it.<br1>
