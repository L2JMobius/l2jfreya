<html><body>Festival Guide:<br1>
If you wish, I'll send you back to the village from where you came. Oh, be careful! If you are in possession of a Blood Offering that you have obtained during the festival, it will disappear as soon as you return to the village.<br1>
And, if you wish to return to the oracle from the village, speak with the priest in the village.<br1>
Do you really wish to return to the village?<br1>
