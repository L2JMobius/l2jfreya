Festival Guide:<br1>
Bonuses are paid during the week after the competition, also known as the seal validation period. Ancient adena is awarded to the party of each level with the highest score.<br1>
If your party has gotten a higher score check with me during the seal validation period to see if you are eligible for a bonus.<br1>
