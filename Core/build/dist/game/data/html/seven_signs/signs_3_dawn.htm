<font color="LEVEL">"[Participation in the Seven Signs]"</font><br1>
Do you wish to participate in the Seven Signs as a member of the Lords of Dawn?<br1>
Remember, if you do, you'll belong to the Lords of Dawn during the next seal validation period. If we win, you'll enjoy the spoils of victory. But if we lose, you must hold your head high through a humiliating loss.<br1>
Do you understand? Do you really want to participate in the Seven Signs?<br1>
