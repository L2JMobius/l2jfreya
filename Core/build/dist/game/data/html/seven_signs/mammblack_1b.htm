I'll make an even exchange of weapons with you. For example, I will exchange a Mithril Dagger for a two-handed Claymore of the same level. However, there are a couple of things you should know.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Special abilities"</font> don't transfer.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Enchantments"</font> do transfer with exchange.<br1>
