<html><body>Vice Hierarch Zenya:<br1>
Vice Hierarch Casca can tell you about the skills available to male Kamael -- I can tell you of the Arbalesters, those skilled female Kamael who make up the secret Steelrazor force.<br1>
Strictly speaking, not all Arbalesters belong to the Steelrazor, just as not all Human Knights belong to a guild.<br1>
Arbalesters learn to mislead and deceive their enemies through their stealth and skill at trapping. Their weapon of choice is the Bow.<br1>
