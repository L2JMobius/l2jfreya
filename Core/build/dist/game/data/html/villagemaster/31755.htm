The Town of Goddard has produced many brave war heroes over the years, but it is also well-regarded as a center of learning and study.<br1>
Do not underestimate these people simply because they live in a relatively wild and untamed region. In fact, the harsher their lives become, the greater their thirst for knowledge. That knowledge is far more than academic, you understand -- it has the power to improve their chances of survival.<br1>
