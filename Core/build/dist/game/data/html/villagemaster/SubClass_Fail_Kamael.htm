<html><body>Add Sub class:<br1>
Unfortunately, you are not eligible to discuss sub class.<br1>
In order to add a sub class, you must meet some necessary qualifications.<br1>
First, <font color="LEVEL">"you should complete the "Seeds of Chaos" quest"</font>. For more information about this quest, visit Hierarch Kekropus in Kamael Village.<br1>
You should complete the "Fate's Whisper" quest before embarking on the "Seeds of Chaos" quest, however. You can receive this quest from Maestro Reorin, who lives in a hut east of the Town of Oren.<br1>
Second, <font color="LEVEL">"you should have a profession for your second or third transfer, and each level of sub class should be above 75"</font>. If your profession is Berserker and you have Soultaker as sub class, for example, each of two must be above 75 in order to add a second sub class.<br1>
Third, <font color="LEVEL">"if you are an Arbalester, Berserker and Soul Breaker, the road to a third sub class will be open"</font>. Experience it for yourself!
