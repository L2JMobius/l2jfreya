The Warriors Guild here in Dion is very influential because of the current situation. To the north are the cursed Cruma Marshlands. Bandits roam the Horseshoe Mountains. And to the east are the Execution Grounds, stained crimson with the blood of so many hapless Humans.<br1>
If you think you can endure harsh training, step forward. I promise you that it will serve you well in your journeys...<br1>
