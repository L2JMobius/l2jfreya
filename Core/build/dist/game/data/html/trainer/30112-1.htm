It is Land Dragon Antharas. It nests in the deepest recesses of the Valley of Dragons. My brother Juris and I are attempting to keep an eye on the creature, even as we are teach magic to our Elven brothers here in this guild.<br1>
If Antharas ever fully awakens, destruction and death will follow. For the sake of this land, we must stay ever vigilant.<br1>
