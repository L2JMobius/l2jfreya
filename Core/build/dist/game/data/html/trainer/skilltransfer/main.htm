Skill Transfer is a system that allows you to learn some of the skills possessed by other classes in your field.<br1>
In order to use this system, you must have completed your 3rd class transfer, which means you must be level 76 or above. In addition, 1 <font color="LEVEL">"Holy Pomander"</font> is required to learn each skill.<br1>
If at any time you change your mind, and wish to learn a skill other than the one you've already selected, you can cleanse the pomander through a special ceremony. But the ceremony is not cheap. Pomander cleansing costs <font color="LEVEL">"10 million adena"</font>, so please make this decision carefully.<br1>
Also, please remember this - the cleansing process will affect all transfer skills. So if you have more than one skill learned, the cleansing will remove them all. Once the fee is paid, the ritual will be performed, and the Holy Pomander will be returned to you.<br1>
(Only Cardinals, Eva's Saints and Shillien Saints are eligible.)<br1>
