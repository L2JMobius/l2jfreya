<html><body>Prefect Marestella:<br1>
We Orcs came to Aden at the request of the weak Human king. Some of my brethren believe this shows that the Humans have finally realized their inadequacies. I prefer to be more cautious, however.<br1>
The Humans have a long history of treachery when it comes to their dealings with the Orcs.<br1>
While we are here, then, I will act as the eyes and ears of my people to ensure we are dealt with honorably...<br1>
