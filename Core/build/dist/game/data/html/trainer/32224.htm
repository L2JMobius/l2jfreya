<html><body>Master Auren:<br1>
I am the master of this Kamael Guild. It is a hard thing, to be this far from home and my comrades.<br1>
Have you met Duroga? This isolation has made him harder than flint, colder than ice.<br1>
He should never have been posted here, but it is our duty to follow orders without question...<br1>
