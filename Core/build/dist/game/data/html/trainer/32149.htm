Nice to meet you, adventurer!<br1>
I'm Magister Ennear, originally from Innadril. Elves are said to be the founders of all magic. But you cannot ignore the fact that both Humans and Dark Elves have contributed greatly to our current magical knowledge. And Kamael magic is far different even from our Dark Elven variety.<br1>
Where did their power come from? I would give my left hand to find out...<br1>
