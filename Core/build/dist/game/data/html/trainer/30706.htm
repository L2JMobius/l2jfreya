Jakal Pa'agrio!<br1>
For the glory of the flame and the benefit of our people, I will willingly transfer my skills to you.<br1>
This place is filled with all sorts of rabble: monsters, penniless adventurers, corrupt mercenaries. I won't allow any of them to besmirch the honorable name of Pa'agrio!<br1>
