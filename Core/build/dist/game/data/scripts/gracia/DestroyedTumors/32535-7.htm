<html><body>Destroyed Tumor:<br>
Long, narrow passages that look like blood vessels form a web of connections among the tumors.<br>
Given the almost suffocating aura of death and decay pulsing through the passages, the other side of the passage must be the core heart, where Ekimus sleeps.<br>
Other passages lead to <font color=LEVEL>another destroyed tumor in the area</font>.<br>
<font color=LEVEL>If you challenge Ekimus now, others inside the core heart will be expelled by his fury.</font><br>
