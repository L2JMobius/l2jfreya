As soon as the reddish-brown liquid that fills the passage touches a body, it causes sharp, terrible pain.<br>
To move through this passage safely, you must use 3 <font color=LEVEL>Tears of Freed Soul</font>, which contain all the victims' anger against Ekimus.<br>
(If the initiating PC possesses 3 Tears of Freed Soul, the entire party can move.)<br>
