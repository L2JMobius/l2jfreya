It is impossible to walk around in Gracia because of the contamination caused by the Seeds. Most move via Airship, but that is also difficult -- there simply aren't enough for everyone.<br1>
The magicians of Aden crafted an alternative plan. It is called an <font color=LEVEL>Aurabird</font>. I think it is the better solution for you.<br1>
