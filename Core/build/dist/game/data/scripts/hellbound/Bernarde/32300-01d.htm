Bernarde:<br1>
He must be from our island -- he has a robust complexion that I haven't seen anywhere else! I have news from those who have visited the 
Ancient Temple Remnants. They say that the soul of Derek, the First Generation Seer, wanders that place. I do not know the truth of these tales, 
but I believe those who told them to me are credible witnesses. Will you go and investigate the Ancient Temple Remnants? If you encounter Derek, 
please help him enter Nirvana.<br1>
