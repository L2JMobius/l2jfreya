Old Dwarven Ghost:<br1>
The room behind me is...a storage area for magical energy...extracted by Beleth...from Hellbound Isle... It is <font color=LEVEL>Core Naia</font>...<br1>
Nature spirits...that once inhabited... the air, the earth and even living things...were trapped in this place for a long, long time... 
They mutated...as they tried to...escape.<br1>
They still possess their elemental nature...fire, water, wind and earth...and they exist separately...<br1>
But they are now interconnected... When they sense danger...they join together in...a powerful spiritual body...<br1>
They are extremely powerful now...difficult to defeat...<br1>
