Kief:<br1>
In the Battered Lands live monsters created by Beleth's dark magic. Just before they die, it is possible to use this magic bottle to obtain their Life Force, 
which contains the original magical energy used to create them. Take it and capture the Chimeras' Life Force, then return to me. 
The Ivory Tower magicians will undoubtedly pay a high price for those Life Forces, even the dim ones. Of course, a Contained Life Force would be even better...<br1>
