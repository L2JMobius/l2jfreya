Spooky Tombstone:<br1>
You see arcane symbols and intricate patterns engraved on the tombstone, which seems to radiate magical power. 
Between the symbols are carved 5 deep grooves, each of which looks just wide enough to insert a small disc. Interestingly, 
each groove is lined with a different metal: tin, lead, iron, copper and white gold.<br1>
<button action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest TullyWorkshop" value="Insert Tully's medal in the groove." width="270" height="25" back="L2UI_ct1.button_df" fore="L2UI_ct1.button_df"><br1>
