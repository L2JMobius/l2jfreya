Old Dwarven Ghost:<br1>
The Tombstone is...a complicated 5-stage mechanism... It has a built-in...safety lock device... To release the device, you need each key... 
You need <font color=LEVEL>5 small metal medals</font>. <br1>
Those medals...can be found...somewhere in this maze... <br1>
The medal's unique owner recognition device won't allow one person to have more than one medal...so don't go looking for the medals...by yourself... <br1>
