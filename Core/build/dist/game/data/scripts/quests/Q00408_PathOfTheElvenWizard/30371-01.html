What have you come here for? Oh... What a delicious looking apple! Is this for me? This reminds me of the legend of the Elven maiden who picked the apple of knowledge.<br1>
Rosella sent you? Are you looking for the <font color=LEVEL>Pure Aquamarine</font>? Rosella asked me before... She told me to kindly tell the whereabouts of the Aquamarine of Water, should anyone ask for it.<br1>
But Aquamarines are not only precious, but a very valuable resource for us Elves. I cannot tell that secret to just anyone. If you perform a task for me, I shall tell you about the Aquamarine.<br1>
