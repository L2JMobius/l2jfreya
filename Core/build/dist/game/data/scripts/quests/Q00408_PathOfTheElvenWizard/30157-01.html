Oh...a letter from my godmother! How is she? I haven't seen her for ages... Hmm, I see you're searching for the Magical Powers Ruby.<br1>
It has been the symbol of my family for 200 years; no one in all of Oren or Gludio knows it better than I do. Rubies were once mined throughout northern Gludio, but those sites all collapsed during the war with Gracia.<br1>
We have been unable to find any trace of the original mines. Fortunately, I still have a small piece of the Magical Powers Ruby. Precious as it is, I will give it to you in exchange for a favor. What do you say?<br1>
