Aghhh! What are you doing here? Hey ... I don't have time ... Just spin the silk out of them. If I don't have twenty dresses by next week, I will be kicked out of the Silver Scale Guild!<br1>
I am telling you once more. You may receive Spider Silks only by hunting <font color=LEVEL>hunter tarantulas</font> or <font color=LEVEL>plunder tarantulas</font>. Just find them quickly and I will pay you back for sure. Also, you may only spin silks by giving <font color=LEVEL>Defender Nathan</font> the<font color=LEVEL> tarantula Spinnerets</font>! You don't have much time! You should be busy hunting spiders now ... you shouldn't waste your time like this! Please hurry, hurry ... I'm about to cry ...<font color=LEVEL>I don't know what to do now!</font><br1>
