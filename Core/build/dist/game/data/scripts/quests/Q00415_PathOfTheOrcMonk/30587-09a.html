Tejakar Oroca! You have brought the Fiery Spirit Scroll! Well done! Now you have the first of the 2 scrolls necessary to become an Orc Monk.<br1>
There are two ways to find the second scroll. You may either obtain it from Prefect Kasman of the Human village of Gludin, or you may seek out Kasman's superior: his teacher, Khavatari Aren. What would you like to do?<br1>
