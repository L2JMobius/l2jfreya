Young one, do you know of the Monks that follow the secret teachings of Pa'agrio? They do not rely on weapons other than their own bodies, believing that through this training they will gain ultimate strength. They have practiced Kabart, the traditional martial art of the Orcs, for thousands of years now.<br1>
Only an Orc whose will is as bright as the sacred flame and whose body is as strong as the finest steel may walk the path of a Monk. But the reward is worthwhile -- Kabart Masters can kill even the largest beast with one blow of their bare hands.<br1>
