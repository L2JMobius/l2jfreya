<html><body>Blueprint Seller Shaling:<br1>
Hello! what ca I do for you? Do you need the blueprint for an extraordinary golem? Sorry, but I have only ordinary ones left now.<br1>
Recently, I completed a really great golem bluprint, but I accidently dropped it off of the bridge and lost it! What a terrible loss!<br1>
