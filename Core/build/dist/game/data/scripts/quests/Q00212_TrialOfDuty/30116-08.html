Well done! I thank you in the name of the church of Einhasad.<br1>
Sir Athebaldt will at last be at peace in the arms of Einhasad. The peace that we now enjoy would not have been possible without sacrifices such as this. Great things are achieved only at great cost... Sometimes a painful sacrifice must be made for the greater good.<br1>
I have written a letter commending your efforts. Take this to <font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Hannavalt</font>.
