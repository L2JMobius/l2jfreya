Thanks for the eyes. Take this <font color=LEVEL>bait of land</font>. It finds more valuable items than baits of wind or chill.<br1>
Remember, this bait only works when your fishing level is exactly 16. Whether or not you land your catch will depend on your skill.<br1>
Remember, if you catch anything besides fish, bring it to me unopened! Don't even bother bringing me opened boxes.
