Thank you for volunteering to help, kind adventurer, but we can't allow inexperienced clan members to put themselves in jeopardy -- bad for our reputation, you know.<br1>
Believe it or not, I was once a prominent adventurer before taking this job.<br1>
If I can give you some advice, you're not quite ready for such a task.<br1>
Why don't you come back to me after you've had an opportunity to further develop your skills.<br1>
(This quest is only available for characters Level 60 or higher.)
