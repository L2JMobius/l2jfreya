I believe this Map will lead us to the prince's gold! I wonder how that delu Lizardman got this?<br1>
If we can get to the gold before our opponents we will be able to hire soldiers and buy weapons with which to defend the village.<br1>
Think of this as your last test.  You must find the other parts of this Map and <font color=LEVEL>get the prince's lost Gold Bar</font>.<br1>
Whether you are successful or not, I will write you the letter of Recommendation you need.<br1>
