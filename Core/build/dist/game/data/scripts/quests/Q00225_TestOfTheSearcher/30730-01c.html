Solt and I were very close... He died on his way home to Elmoreden. Murdered by thieves called <font color=LEVEL>Road Scavengers</font>...<br1>
Makell was the idealist, he joined the rebel army... In the end, he was caught and executed. His body was hung from a tree as a reminder to others... This tree grew animated, and is now known as the <font color=LEVEL>Hangman Tree</font>.<br1>
Rambert was very much like me, working as a high trader's Guard. He lost his life in battle with a Delu Lizardman.<br1>
And now you hold the Map!<br1>
