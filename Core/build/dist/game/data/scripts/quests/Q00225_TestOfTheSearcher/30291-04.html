Thank you for dealing with the delu Lizardman. I heard of your triumph from Leirynn.<br1>
What's this, you found a <font color=LEVEL>Strange Map</font>? Let me see it...<br1>
Hmm... Dion territory... I can barely make out this name in the lower corner... 'Lambert'... Where have I heard that...?<br1>
Oh yes...  One of the Lord's royal guards had that name!<br1>
