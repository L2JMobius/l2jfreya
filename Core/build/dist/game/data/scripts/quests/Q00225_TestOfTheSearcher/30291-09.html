Hmmm, it seems the royal guards hid the gold before it reached the prince!  Now we can be sure that the gold exists, our only problem remaining is how to find it.  First, of course, we must find the <font color=LEVEL>other 3 parts of the Map</font>...<br1>
I am afraid that the delu lizardmen are also on the search for the gold, and their numbers are increasing...<br1>
We must find the gold before they do! Please hurry!
