Good job! 30 good Ol Mahums!<br1>
This is just the beginning of the carnage! They shall rue the day they deceived us! We will attack their barracks at dawn and give no quarter!<br1>
Go to Gludin and tell them that they are off the hook... For now. One day the mighty Turek tribe will sweep down like a black cloud and destroy them!
