I'm glad to have you on the force! Makes me more optimistic about our chances...<br1>
Anyway, I called you here to ask you a favor. I sent a group of scouts into the Swamp of Screams to investigate the ongoing conflict there, but we've lost contact with one of them. I need someone to find out what happened. Are you up to the task?<br1>
