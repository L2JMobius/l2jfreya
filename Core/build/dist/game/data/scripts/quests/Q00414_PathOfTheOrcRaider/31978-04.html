Very well! Then pay close attention!<br1>
The <font color=LEVEL>Timora Orcs</font> betrayed us by joining the dreaded Ragna Orcs, who have long been the scourge of this area. They can usually be found near <font color=LEVEL>the lake  between the Crypts of Disgrace and the Den of Evil</font>. They hide in the Den of Evil whenever they hear that we're sending a powerful Orc after them.<br1>
Letting their betrayal go unchallenged would harm the reputation of the entire Orc Kingdom! If we secretly send an unknown Orc like you after them, they might be taken off-guard...<br1>
Please, destroy the Timora Orcs!<br1>
