The power that you felt comes from this small stone. It's the part of the fourth Stone of Commune. However, you must find the other fragments and put all of the fragments together to properly operate the Stone of Commune.<br1>
The other fragments of the Stone of Commune are worshiped by the barbarians of this area as the 'Divine Stone of Wisdom'. As far as I know, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos have them. You must gain their trust first and attain the stone by some means or other. But, both tribes are notorious for being rough and belligerent. I don't know which tribe you should approach...<br1>
