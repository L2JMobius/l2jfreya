First, you must speak with<font color=LEVEL> Messenger Naran Ashanuk</font> of the Varka Silenos tribe. They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to earn their trust!<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Soul Guide Udan Mardui</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Varka Silenos, has something they call the<font color=LEVEL> Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>. You must get it from them!<br1>
If things don't go well with the Varka, you should try the Ketra Orc tribe. They also have one of the stones. Good luck!</body></html>
