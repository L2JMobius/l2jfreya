First, you must speak with<font color=LEVEL> Messenger Wahkan</font> of the Ketra Orcs. They're hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to earn their trust!<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Soul Guide Asefa</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Ketra Orcs, has something they call the<font color=LEVEL> Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>.<br1>
 We must get it from them! If things don't go well with Asefa, try the Varka Silenos tribe. They have one too.<br1>
Good luck!</body></html>
