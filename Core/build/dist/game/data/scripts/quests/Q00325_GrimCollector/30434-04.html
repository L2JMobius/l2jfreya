You have returned already? I see you have not found the items I asked you for. I am very disappointed...<br1>
I will explain to you again, so listen carefully. Go to the <font color=LEVEL>Ruins of Despair</font> or the <font color=LEVEL>Ruins of Agony</font> and find me the <font color=LEVEL>corpse pieces</font> of the undead and I will give you an ample reward. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Curtis or Guard Babenco.<br1>
