<html><body>Guard Curtis:<br1>
If you are thinking of going to the ruins, I can give you an errand that you will find rewarding. Just recently, I spoke with <font color=LEVEL>Samed</font>, who lives near the edge of the village... He asked me to refer a few skilled friends to him, when guards or mercenary soldier troops were dispatched near the ruins.<br1>
I myself have helped him out a few times. The job is a little unpleasant, but... the pay is good. What do you say, do you want to give it a try?<br1>
