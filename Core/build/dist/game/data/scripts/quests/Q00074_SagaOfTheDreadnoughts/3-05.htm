<html><body>Grand Master Bernhard:<br1>
 You're back! Did you bring the Divine Stone of Wisdom?<br1>
 Good job! You are as capable as the bride of Antharas told me.<br1>
 Now I'll give you the Stone of Commune. The stone tablet that forms a union with it is north of the Varka Silenos stronghold.<br1>
 I'd like to see it myself, but I'm not a descendant of a dragon like you. The bride left a note with me.<br1>
