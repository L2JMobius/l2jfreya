Ah, these weapons are exquisite! I see that you brought me 200 weapons, just as you promised. You can exchange these <font color=LEVEL>200 Evil Weapons for the S80 Grade weapon recipe</font>, or if you prefer, I can give you <font color=LEVEL>3 weapon pieces for every 5 Evil Weapons you have</font>.<br1>
What is your preference?<br1>
