You still don't have <font color=LEVEL>5 </font>Evil Weapons. You can obtain more from the <font color=LEVEL>Lesser Evils and Greater Evils in the Monster Foundry</font>. Do your best! If you collect <font color=LEVEL>200 Evil Weapons</font>, I will exchange them for the S80 Grade weapon recipe. If you prefer, I can also exchange 5 Evil Weapons for 3 S80 Grade weapon pieces.<br1>
Do you want to continue?<br1>
