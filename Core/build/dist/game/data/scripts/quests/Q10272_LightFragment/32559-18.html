Very well done. I'm sure it was a difficult trip, but you exceeded my expectations. This now contains the sacred energy of the Mother Tree.<br1>
It will not be particularly effective against normal undead, but it can strike a great blow against Tiat. Keep this sacred sign with you in case you encounter her. You won't regret it.<br1>
Here is a reward for your efforts so far. Use it well.<br1>
(Double-click the sacred sign to use it against Tiat; it can only be used once, and only against her.)
