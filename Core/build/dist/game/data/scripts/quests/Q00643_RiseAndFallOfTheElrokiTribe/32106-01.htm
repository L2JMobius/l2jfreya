Ah, an adventurer! Are you looking for a job? Since the discovery of this Primeval Isle, Aden port has added a wharf for those interested in seeing the strange new island for themselves.<br1>
In fact, we're getting flooded with adventurers and wizards eager to uncover the island's mysteries or test their mettle against the terrible creatures there.<br1>
We handle tickets here for the ship bound for the island as well as offering accommodations for those who wish to trade with the natives.<br1>
Now we have expanded our service to connect adventurers with those in need of their services.<br1>
Ah, but there is one request I have...<br1>
