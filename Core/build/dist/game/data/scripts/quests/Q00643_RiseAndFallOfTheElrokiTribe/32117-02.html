We know not... Perhaps we have been unfaithful. But we must win back Shilen's favor. Without it, we grow weaker with each passing season, sickening like a tree deprived of sunlight. Without her blessing, our race grows weaker and weaker... We become ill... Even the dinosaurs that we once commanded turn against us, tearing our people to pieces!<br1>
Outsider, if you are willing to help us to earn back the favor of Shilen,<br1>
please donate <font color=LEVEL>300 bones from the dinosaurs of the plains</font>.<br1>
