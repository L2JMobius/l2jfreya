Ah, an adventurer! Are you looking for a job? Since the discovery of this Primeval Isle, Aden port has added a wharf for those interested in seeing the strange new island for themselves.<br1>
In fact, we're getting flooded with adventurers and wizards eager to uncover the island's mysteries or test their mettle against the terrible creatures there.<br1>
We handle tickets here for the ship bound for the island as well as offering accommodations for those who wish to trade with the natives.<br1>
Now we have expanded our service to connect adventurers with those in need of their services.<br1>
I have just one request, but hmmm...<br1>
I don't think that you're suited for this particular task.<br1>
(Only characters level 75 and above are permitted to take on this quest.)
