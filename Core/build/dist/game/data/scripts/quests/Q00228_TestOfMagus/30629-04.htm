<html><body>Bard Rukal:<br1>
Good. First let me tell you something about myself.<br1>
My nights are sleepless, haunted by the songs of the spirits.  This is a condition common to the practitioners of Elemental Magic.<br1>
This inhuman song is not of this earth, and can make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, and a cold shiver run down your spine.<br1>
You must find the source of this music. I know someone who can help you.  I will introduce you to Parina, who is in the temple of Gludin. She has a profound knowledge of Elemental Magic.<br1>
She will help you find the source of this unworldly music if you show her this letter.
