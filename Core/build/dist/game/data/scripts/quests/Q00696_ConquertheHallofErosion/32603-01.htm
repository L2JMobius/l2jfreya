When the Seed first revealed its magic power, Keucereus Alliance Base survived thanks only to the power of the Barrier. But this region was much closer to the source of that dark magic. Everyone in the area, whether they opposed the Seed or collaborated with it, were transformed into corrupted undead.<br1>
Cohemenes, who guards this Hall of Erosion, now controls that murderer Argekunte. They were enemies in life; as undead, they both serve the cause of evil. Unless Cohemenes himself is defeated, his minion cannot be vanquished either.<br1>
Above all else, you must destroy Cohemenes.<br1>
