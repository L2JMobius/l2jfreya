Why don't I tell you about our current membership? <br1>
Here's the list of our current members: <font color=LEVEL>Magister Page</font> of the Wizard Guild, <font color=LEVEL>Researcher Lorain</font> at the Entrance to Cruma Tower <font color=LEVEL>Warehouse Keeper Haggar</font> in the Town of Oren, <font color=LEVEL>Guard Stan</font> in the Town of Oren, <font color=LEVEL>Blacksmith Duning</font> in Hunters Village, <font color=LEVEL>Merchant Ralford</font> in the underground floor of the Ivory Tower, <font color=LEVEL>Head Blacksmith Ferris</font> in the Town of Aden, <font color=LEVEL>Warehouse Keeper Collob</font> in front of the Accessory Store in the Town of Giran and <font color=LEVEL>Grocer Pano</font> at the plaza in Floran Village...<br1>Wow! We are widespread, aren't we? But we still have a long way to go. My dream is to establish the coins that we are collecting to be the 2nd currency of this continent! Then everyone on the continent will become members of our club! Ha ha ha! That would be great, don't you think? <br1>
