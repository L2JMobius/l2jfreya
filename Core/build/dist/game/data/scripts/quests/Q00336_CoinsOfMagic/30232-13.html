Excellent! You have mastered the skills necessary for A-Grade 2 Member Certificate. But there's a world o' difference 'tween Grade 2 and Grade 3. For that Certificate, you will need to pass a much more difficult — and dangerous — test.<br1>
If you've the heart to attempt it, bring me these coins and you'll earn your Grade 3 Certificate. <br1>
<font color=LEVEL>1 Blood Werewolf</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>1 Gold Drake</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>1 Silver Fairy</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>1 Blood Drevanul</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>1 Gold Knight</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>1 Silver Golem</font><br1>
I will await your return. Good luck!
