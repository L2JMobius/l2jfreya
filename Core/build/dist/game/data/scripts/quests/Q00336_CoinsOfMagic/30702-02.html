Long ago Mystics cast a spell on this coin that caused it to shine in colors unique to whatever Mystic might be holding it. They were crafted by the finest Dwarven Artisans of the time. High level magic power was bestowed upon many coins to turn them into sublime works of art. It is said that Mystics used them as their own personal marks. They could be given as a mark of gratitude or as the mark of a curse.<br1>This coin was given to my ancestor as a reward. Over the years, Mystics were mistaken for demons and many of them were killed. All the coins confiscated from them were considered accursed objects and were disposed of near the places where the Mystics were executed. Nowadays these coins have become mere collectible trinkets of ignorant fools like Sorint.<br1>
