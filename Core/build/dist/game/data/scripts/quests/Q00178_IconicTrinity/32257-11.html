N: For ages, this Isle of Souls acted as a seal between dimensions, but as you can see, the island and its inhabitants, the Kamael, have now been unsealed. It is unknown who was reponsible for unsealing the island, but the first outsiders to set foot on the newly unsealed Isle of Souls were a man in black armor and a lady in a blue dress. Hierarch Kekropus treated them very cordially, almost as if they were royalty or...something greater. A few months later, the Kamael came to this island one by one...<br1>
Now that the Isle of Souls has been unsealed, it is the focus of the world's collective attention.<br1>
