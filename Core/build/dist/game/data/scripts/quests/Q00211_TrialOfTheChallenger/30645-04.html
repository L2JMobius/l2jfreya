So, you have killed Gorr? Congratulations! Unfortunately, just now the villagers of Floran were attacked again by another evil creature.<br1>
This time the creature is called <font color=LEVEL>'Baraham'</font>. Perhaps he came to avenge the death of Gorr... Anyway, <font color=LEVEL>you should search the other caves near Gorr's shelter...</font>
