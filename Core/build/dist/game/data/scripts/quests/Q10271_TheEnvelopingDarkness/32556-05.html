I thought about that. But I'm too injured. And even if I weren't, I'm not sure I could go back there. I've never been so scared in all my life....<br1>
Why are you so interested? I guess you came here looking for information about the Seed of Destruction, eh? Well, if you coud recover that document, you'd get all the information we currently have about the Seed.<br1>
Perhaps you can help me...<br1>
It won't bring our dead soldiers back, but completing that mission will restore their honor -- and mine. You'd have my eternal gratitude.<br1>
