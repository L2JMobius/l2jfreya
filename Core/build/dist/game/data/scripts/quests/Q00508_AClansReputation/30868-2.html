Sir Eric Rodemai:<br1>
Then kill <font color=LEVEL>Shillien Priest Hisilrome</font> and bring me his heart.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>As I mentioned before, you don't have to kill Hisilrome yourself.</font> There is no rule that says the clan leader has to use his sword personally. <font color=LEVEL>If your clan members defeat Hisilrome, simply bring back proof of the victory.</font>
