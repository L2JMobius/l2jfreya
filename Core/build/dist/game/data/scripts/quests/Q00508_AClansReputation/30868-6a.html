Sir Eric Rodemai:<br1>
Very well, go and kill the <font color=LEVEL>Flamestone Giant</font> and bring me the Nucleus of Flamestone Giant.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Remember, you don't have to kill Flamestone Giant yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color=LEVEL>Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Flamestone Giant and then bring me back the Nucleus of Flamestone Giant.</font><br1>
