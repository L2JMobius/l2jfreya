Excellent! Visit the Kamaloka we can enter from Rune, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.<br1>
You will face the <font color=LEVEL>White Allosce</font> Kaneus.<br1>
When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the Kaneus, take them to <font color=LEVEL>Magister Kayan</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br1>
Good hunting!
