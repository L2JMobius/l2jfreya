Ah! Are these the <font color=LEVEL>cellular tissue of White Allosce</font>?<br1>
From their pristine appearance, I can tell you were very careful. I couldn't have done better myself. Well done!<br1>
Now take these samples to <font color=LEVEL>Magister Kayan</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. He will be very pleased.<br1>
If we can determine the nature of the mutated Kaneus, your efforts will not be forgotten! But there is no time to waste, so hurry and take these samples to <font color=LEVEL>Magister Kayan</font> before they deteriorate!
