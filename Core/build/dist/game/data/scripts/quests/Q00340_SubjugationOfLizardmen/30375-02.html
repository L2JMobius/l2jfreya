Oh, thank you! The site of the massacre is on the south shore of Gludio. Please find and return the remains of Priestess Agnes so that we can give her a proper burial.<br1>
Please, bring us her <font color=LEVEL>crucifix</font> and <font color=LEVEL>rosary</font>.<br1>
Now please be off, time is of the essence...
