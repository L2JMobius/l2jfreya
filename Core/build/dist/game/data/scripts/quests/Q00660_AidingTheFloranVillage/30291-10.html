Take Timothy there. He and his friend Jeremy were working a new field they had bought with their shared savings. They put everything into that effort. Not long ago, the two of them were hard at work, each taking turns at the plow, when something - we're not sure what - attacked them. Jeremy was at the plow, and it slowed him down, so he didn't make it. Timothy wanted to help, but in the face of such an attack he was helpless, and with a bitter curse, he ran.<br1>
Timothy says the only way he can live with himself now is to offer 100 dead monsters as recompense, to put his friend's soul to rest. I've told him it won't bring Jeremy back, but he won't listen. Honestly, though, I have no idea how he'd get 100 dead monsters. But it sure would take a load off of his soul.<br1>
