Soldier, you've done us a great favor, and mere thanks aren't enough. I can't offer much, but Maria insisted that I give you something. It won't fetch you any gold, but it's valuable to her, and it's a gift from the heart. You'd be doing all of us a kindness by accepting it. And who knows? It might help you somehow, somewhere.<br1>
