You have the gratitude of the whole of Floran! I'm sorry we have no gold or other reward to offer you beyond our thanks. Of course, for soldiers like us, that's often times a greater reward than gold. Well, I suppose I can offer you a small gift. I wish it were more, but you'd oblige me by taking it, and poor Timothy as well.<br1>
