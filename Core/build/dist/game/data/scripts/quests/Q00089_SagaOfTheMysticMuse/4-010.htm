I missed Arkenias, but I robbed him of the Stone of Commune! Either he was hiding it to try to interrupt, or he's guarding the tablet to prevent you communing with it.<br1>
He didn't put up much of a fight, he could easily have handled us both.<br1>
This should finish your class transfer. See you later, I must follow Arkenias to find out the truth.<br1>
