Tarkai gave me your instructions.<br>
The Human soul you released can't rest in peace, you must find him again!<br>
Here's your test. The Ketra Orcs, a lower race who betrayed us long ago, and the Varka Silenos are at war. They each have a<font color=LEVEL> Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>, but you must earn their absolute trust to get it.<br>
Bring either stone to pass the test.<br>
Which side do you choose?<br>
