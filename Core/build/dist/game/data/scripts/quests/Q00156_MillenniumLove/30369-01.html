Theon ... Yes, I knew him well. He is the man who taught me how to use the sword and bow. A silent and stern person, but he was also a sensitive man who longed for his long lost lover. The woman he so missed ... is still alive ... the web of fate that the arachnes weave is sometimes cruelly twisted, I think. That two lovers longed for each other for all those years, with only a small distance between them ...<br1>
Unfortunately, Theon returned to the arms of Eva a few years ago. I personally transported his body to the Elven Forest and buried him under the Mother Tree's roots. Ah, if only Lilith had written this letter just a little sooner ...<br1>
While living in this small Human town, Theon wrote many beautiful poems and songs to pass the time while longing for his lover of a thousand years. I urged him to write down the poems and songs in a diary. Before he passed away, he entrusted me with his diary. Please ... deliver this <font color=LEVEL>diary</font> to Lilith.<br1>
