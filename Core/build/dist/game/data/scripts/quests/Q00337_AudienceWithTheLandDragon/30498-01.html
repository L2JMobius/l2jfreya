<html><body>Warehouse Chief Moke:<br1>
Is that a Feather of Gabrielle? Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Moke, watcher of the seal. I was trained by the Gray Pillar Guild. I am currently employed as a warehouse keeper, guarding the Bronze Gate.<br1>
For generations we Dwarves have used the power of a seal to bind the evil spirits of Shilen within columns. As long as a column remains upright, evil spirits cannot escape the power of the seal.<br1>
Unfortunately, the column restraining the evil dragon Antharas is under attack. The followers of the beast are attempting to free their master by using an Abyssal Jewel.<br1>
