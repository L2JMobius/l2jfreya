I heard that a Dwarven explorer discovered some records left by the Giants about your race at the Giants' Ruins.<br1>
Unfortunately, both he and the records seem to have disappeared. Nobody knows if he is alive or dead...<br1>
I heard this from my close friend <font color=LEVEL>Holvas</font>, so if you're interested in that book, I think you should ask him about it.<br1>
I seem to remember him telling me that he might be able to get a copy... Why don't you go see him?
