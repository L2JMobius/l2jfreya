Really? Thank you.<br1>
If you hunt <font color=LEVEL>Rok</font> and open its stomach, you will find undigested remains. The same is true of the <font color=LEVEL>Mutant Birds and Dra Hawks</font>, although you'll find fewer remains in them.<br1>
Bring me <font color=LEVEL>Swallowed Skulls</font> as evidence, as well as <font color=LEVEL>Swallowed Sternums</font> and <font color=LEVEL>Swallowed Bones</font>. We will reward you for your efforts -- especially for the skulls you bring back.<br1>
One more thing: Rok fears the Dark Black Dragon's followers. That's why it emerges only when the Seed of Infinity is <font color=LEVEL>stabilized</font>. That means <font color=LEVEL>Rok can only be hunted when the Seed is occupied</font>. Remember that!<br1>
Good luck and good hunting.
