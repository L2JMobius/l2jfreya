 Well, shall I check your records? Let's see, you were educated at the Temple of Shilen, obtained a certificate of Dark Wizard from the Altar of Rites in the Dark Forest, passed the Test of the Summoner with flying colors, and even attained the Recommendation of Galatea!<br1>
Your records are awesome! You won't have any problem! In fact, I've got you in mind for a very special position...<br1>
I'm thinking of recommending that you be made a<font color=LEVEL> Spectral Master</font>! It won't be easy, but your skills are extraordinary! Will you take the challenge?<br1>
