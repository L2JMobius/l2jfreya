Give me the Scroll of Ancient Magic and step back...<br1>
... the light of purification. It is cast on the shadows. The flames of soul... burning up the darkness...<br1>
It's done. The magic is removed. Here is the <font color=LEVEL>Blank Scroll</font> I promised you.<br1>
This Blank Scroll will be helpful to you when you trade with the <font color=LEVEL>Merchant of Mammon</font> who appears in the sacred area once in a while.<br1>
If you would like to collect more Blank Scrolls, enter the sacred area, slay the <font color=LEVEL>guardians of ancient cult</font> and bring me back more <font color=LEVEL>scrolls of ancient magic</font>.<br1>
