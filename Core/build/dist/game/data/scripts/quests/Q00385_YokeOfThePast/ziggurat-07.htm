So, you've found me out!<br1>
To be honest with you, I need the magic power contained in the scrolls. This is so that I can be freed from the spell that is binding me to this place! I want so much to be human again!<br1>
So, I beseech you. Please help me. Please go find the scrolls of ancient magic and bring them back to me.<br1>
