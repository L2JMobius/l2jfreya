As I said, go into the sacred area, slay <font color=LEVEL>the guardians of ancient cult</font> and bring back the <font color=LEVEL>Scroll of Ancient Magic</font>.<br1>
Then I will remove the magic power from the scroll and give you a <font color=LEVEL>Blank Scroll</font> as a reward. That is the only reward I can give you.<br1>
A Blank Scroll will also be helpful to you if you trade with the <font color=LEVEL>Merchant of Mammon</font> who appears in the sacred area every once in a while.<br1>
