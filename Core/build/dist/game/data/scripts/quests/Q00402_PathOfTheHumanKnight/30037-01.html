This is the holy hall of Einhasad. How could you clad yourself with the tools of war and enter the most holy place? From your mark, I see you are a Knight in training. If that is the case, shouldn't you show all the more respect in the Temple of Einhasad? Next time, enter the temple in a more reverent costume.<br1>
