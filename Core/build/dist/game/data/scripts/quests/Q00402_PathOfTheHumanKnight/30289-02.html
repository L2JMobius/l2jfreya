<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br1>
Of course! You see, we must ask the alliance's help again.<br1>
A few years ago, during the war with Gracia, we sent several priests to a small village in the south. The priest treated the wounded and performed funerals for the  dead there, but one day the village was attacked by mercenaries. Men, woman, child... it didn't matter - each was butchered where they stood. Their bodies may have decayed over time, but the spirits of the dead there have not peace and still haunt the village ruins as undead spectres.<br1>
Of course, it is the duty of the priest to console their spirits and put them to rest through player, but it is too dangerous for someone like myself to face the horrors in those ruins. That is why I am asking you a favor.<br1>
