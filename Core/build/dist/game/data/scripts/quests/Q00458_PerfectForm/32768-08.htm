<html><head><body>Kelleyia:<br1>Really... you really want me to go over this again? It is simple. 
Find an <font color=LEVEL>Alpine Kookaburra, Alpine Cougar, Alpine Buffalo, or Alpine Grendel</font> and feed 
it on spice until it grows into an adult. Speak to my associate over here to purchase spice.<br1>Once it is an adult, 
kill it trying to score as many <font color=LEVEL>Over-hits and Critical Over-hits</font> as possible.<br1>
The limit is <font color=LEVEL>10 of each</font> type of animal. That's a total of 40 if you can't add. 
If you can't score an Over-hit before killing an animal, you'll have to wait until tomorrow to try again.<br1>
Do you think you can follow these directions?<br1>
