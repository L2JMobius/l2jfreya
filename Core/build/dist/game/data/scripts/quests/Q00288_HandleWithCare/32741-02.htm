Oh, one last thing before you go. There are these plants called <font color=LEVEL>Abyss Weed</font> 
that grow around <font color=LEVEL>Tanta Seer Ugoros</font>. When he eats these plants it restores him 
and turns his scales into armor.<br1><font color=LEVEL>His scales are of the best quality when he has 
NOT eaten the abyss weed.</font><br1>If you can get me this type of scale your reward might be more than 
you imagine. Do we have a deal?<br1>
