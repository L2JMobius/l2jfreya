I like the way that you work. Dedicated. Get back to the fields and get rid of the Mucrokian threat. Remember to collect hides from the <font color=LEVEL>Mucrokian Fanatic, Mucrokian Ascetic, Mucrokian Savior, Mucrokian Preacher, and Contaminated Mucrokian</font>...<br1>
Oh, and if you get an <font color=LEVEL>Awakened Mucrokian Hide</font>, that reduces the amount of hides required to claim a reward.<br1>
See ya in a bit.
