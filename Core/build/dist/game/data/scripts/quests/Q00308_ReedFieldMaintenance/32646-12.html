Hmm... You haven't completed Dr. Hell Doscozer's request. We can't fully trust you yet. If you decide you've finished your mission now, I'll have to deduct a fee from the reward.<br1>
How about it? Do you want the full reward later, or do you want to receive the reward now even if you'll have a smaller amount?<br1>
