<html><body>Elder Cronos:<br1>Let me guess. You have come for a hatchling, am I right? You should reconsider this foolish choice! It will not fight and eats like a pig. You cannot ride it, but must escort it about like it is your master. Why do you want something that will give you such trouble and heartache? I suppose you want to raise it to be a wyvern. If it were that easy, I, Cronos, would be astride one instead of sitting here talking to you!<br1>
You should not expect more from a pet than to be cute and cuddly. I don't approve of your choice at all.<br1>
