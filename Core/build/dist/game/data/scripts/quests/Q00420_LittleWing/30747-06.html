Ah, yes, I know why you have come. You want a hatchling, don't you? Well, its not as easy as that. To obtain a hatchling, you must obtain the egg of a wyvern and hatch it. The wyvern will not surrender her egg without a fight... Your race gives live birth, doesn't it? Anyway, if someone were to ask you for your child, would you gladly give it? No? Oh, really...<br1>
Well, your generosity must be rewarded, I shall tell you a valuable secret... It is not necessary for the egg to come from a wyvern! Any egg from a scaled flying creature will do, such as a drake or wyvern... Their eggs will be easier to get since they have been acting odd lately... Anyway, they can tell you more...<br1>
