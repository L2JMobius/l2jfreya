How would you know about that skill?<br1>
Hmm... I assume Marquez probably told you about it.<br1>
I'm sorry, but the skill can only be taught to members of our tribe. It is forbidden to teach it to outsiders.<br1>
If you understood our tribe better, as Marquez does, it might be a different matter...<br1>
(It seems you must return to Marquez and ask him for advice on how to best interact with the Elroki tribe.)
