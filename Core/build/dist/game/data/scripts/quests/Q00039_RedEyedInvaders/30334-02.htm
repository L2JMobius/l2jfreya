<html><body>Guard Babenco:<br1>
I just received a report that a large army of savage <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardmen</font> is gathering in the western section of the Town of Gludio. They're not satisfied staying on the plains.<br1><font color=LEVEL>Captain Bathis</font> is recruiting militiamen in Gludio, and we need help, but this is too dangerous for beginners.<br1>
(Only a character of level 20 or above can undertake this quest.)
