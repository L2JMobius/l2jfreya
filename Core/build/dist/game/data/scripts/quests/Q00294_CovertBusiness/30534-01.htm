<html><body>Elder Keef:<br1>
As you know, the <font color=LEVEL> Bronze Key Guild</font> travels the continent collecting rare materials. We received a request, and I'm looking for a person with the right qualification to manage the assignment.<br1>
I'm in urgent need of a person, but I can't give this job to just anybody in off the street ... It's hard to find reliable help these days. Do you have any friends for this job? Someone diligent, and responsible, and that can keep a secret.<br1>
(Quest for Dwarven characters level 10 and above.)
