Is this Work Hammer for me? Thank you! You will be blessed!<br1>
What? Money? I don't have any, silly!<br1>
By the way, I need another favor! My son went to Talking Island seeking adventure! He'll be graduating soon, and I want to send him this Work Hammer as a graduation present.<br1>
But there are some fearsome bandits laying in wait around here. You must kill them! <font color=LEVEL>Of course, I'll still need the Work Hammer.</font><br1>
