I've been waiting for you.<br1>You've undertaken the trial as the ranking guild member, 
and helped Reorin save his wife's soul and restore his reputation. You don't have to live the life of a criminal anymore. 
Drinking Mimir's Elixir allows you to create your own destiny. It was no coincidence that Talien met you. 
It all matches my granddaughter's dream!<br1>
