 You've brought the Divine Stone of Wisdom, right?<br1>
 All right. Now, I'll give you the Stone of Commune.<br1>
 Actually, I'm hoping to get two stones of sacred wisdom! One from the Varka Silenos and one from the Ketra Orcs... If I had two stones, I could meet with the chiefs of both tribes!<br1>
 If I could just get them talking, I think we could establish a peace that would let us share our common land to our mutual benefit!<br1>
 Ah, yes! You wanted the Stone of Commune, right?<br1>
