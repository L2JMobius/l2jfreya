Oh, great! Please bring me 80 <font color=LEVEL>leaves of eucalyptus</font>... That should be enough for one barrel of wine.<br1>
I'll need some <font color=LEVEL>stones of chill </font> to properly age the wine... 100 should be enough.<br1>
If you bring me these items, I'll give you a genuine bottle of Dion wine! No cost is too high for the sake of my precious daughter!
