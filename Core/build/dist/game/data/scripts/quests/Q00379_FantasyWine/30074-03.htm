Well, let's see, I'll need some leaves of eucalyptus... They can be obtained from an <font color=LEVEL>Enku Orc champion</font>. To properly age the wine I'll require some stones of chill... They're made and used by the <font color=LEVEL>Enku Orc shaman</font>. Bring these items to me and I'll make the wine.<br1>
