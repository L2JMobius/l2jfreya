Do you know about the flower called <font color=LEVEL>nightshade</font>? It is a very beautiful plant with a sweet scent that only blossoms at night. The juice is very poisonous, but if it is processed properly it can be used in making reagents that have many uses. Recently, I have begun raising nightshade in my herb garden. However, I am still learning the craft, so everything is very crude compared to Tetrarch Vellior's herb garden.<br1>
To make nightshade fertilizer I must collect all sorts of odd ingredients, and it requires a lot of time and effort. I need someone to collect ingredients for me. Could you help me?<br1>
