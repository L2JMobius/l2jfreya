I may look chipper, but I feel terrible! Recently a delivery of ingredients for our bait of chill was hijacked by <font color=LEVEL>fettered souls</font> at the <font color=LEVEL>Death Pass</font>! It was several years worth of supplies! A devastating loss!<br1>
Are you here for bait? Sorry, I couldn't make any if I wanted to. What can I do?<br1>
