<html><body>Brother Metheus:<br1>
Thank you so much. At last my sister can have a decent burial...<br1>
If you could please help me with one more thing, I need you to bring me some <font color=LEVEL>'Belladonna'</font>. I have read that this poison can kill a bull with just one droplet!  I intend to kill Priest Criton, who executed my sister with this same poison.<br1>
Isn't it true that your race has some familiarity with poisons?<br1>
Please fetch the Belladonna as soon as possible and I will give you the skull of Brother Alders.
