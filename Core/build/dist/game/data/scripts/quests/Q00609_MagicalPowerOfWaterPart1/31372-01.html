<html><body>Soul Guide Asefa:<br1>
Welcome, comrade of Ketra! Wahkan has told me of your activities. I'm sure that you're the right person for this mission!<br1>
We Ketra Orcs are unrivaled warriors. The Silenos cannot defeat us, but they've been a nuisance to our noble corps for far too long! I'm convinced that they're receiving help from some unknown power!<br1>
Break into the Varka Silenos barracks and take the totem of Soul Guide Udan Mardui! This totem must be the source of their hidden power. You can't risk capture, so avoid confronting them directly.<br1>
Once you do this, I'll give you the <font color=LEVEL>Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>, a sacred relic of our tribe!<br1>
The totem is locked inside a box, so don't forget to take the <font color=LEVEL>Thief Key</font> with you. You must hurry, comrade!
