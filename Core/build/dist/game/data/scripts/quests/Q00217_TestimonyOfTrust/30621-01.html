Hello!  Help from anyone is welcomed.<br1>
Hidden away deep inside Cruma Tower is a mechanical brain known as the <font color=LEVEL>Core</font>.<br1>
For thousands of years, this artifact of Giant high-level technology slept.  Recently, whether of its own volition or someone else's, it awoke. It began controlling creatures' actions and threatening the lives of nearby residents. It has also had a terrible effect on the 'Black Anvil' Guild, who specialize in Giant technology.<br1>
