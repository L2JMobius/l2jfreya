Building trust between Elves and Humans is easier said than done... <br1>
You foolish Humans... First you betray your faith and now claim to want it back... Totally untrustworthy! If you are sincere you must prove yourself to me!<br1>
Our forest was devastated during the war with the Humans. Of course, we share some of the blame for the destruction, but your race started the war in the first place, and bear most of the responsibility for it! If you truly wish to build trust between our races, you must endeavor to repair the damage!<br1>
