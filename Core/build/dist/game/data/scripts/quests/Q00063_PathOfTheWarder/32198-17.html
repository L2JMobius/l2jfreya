Well, if you say so...<br1>
I have my doubts, but our options are limited.<br1>
Do it, then!<br1>
According to a report one of our men found on the body of one of the Xekerin Troops, Tak is hiding with the Maille Lizardmen.<br1>
Take this Soul Crystal and go to the <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardmen Barracks</font>. If you slay the <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardmen</font> there, <font color=LEVEL>Tak, a staff officer of the Ol Mahum</font>, will appear.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>When Tak is sufficiently weakened, he can be captured using this Soul Crystal.</font><br1>
Good hunting!</body></html>
