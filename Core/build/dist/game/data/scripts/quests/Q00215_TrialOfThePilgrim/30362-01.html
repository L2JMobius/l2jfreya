Did you bring a message from Santiago? In search of the truth, are you? Your timing could not be better.<br1>
I have a favor to ask. There is a Priestess named <font color=LEVEL>Uruha</font> in the Neutral Zone. She invaded this forest with her spirits known as <font color=LEVEL>Black Willows</font>. You must destroy these spirits.<br1>
The Black Willows are located near the <font color=LEVEL>Waterfalls in the northern part of the Neutral Zone</font>. After destroying them, <font color=LEVEL>go to Uruha and warn her not to come to the Elven Forest ever again.</font> After you do this we can discuss what you seek.
