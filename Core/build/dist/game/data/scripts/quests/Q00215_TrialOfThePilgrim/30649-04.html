So hot! So hot! My body feels as if it will burst into flame. Aieee!<br1>
Wait... what's this? The Flame of Combative Spirit? Truly, this is the mind possessed by the warriors of old. ..<br1>
What is that, there in the distance? What do my old eyes perceive? Oh! Oh! Stay away!  The heat, the heat! Ah! Ah, I see... Is this the Flame of Destruction, which engulfs everything in its path and leaves only black ashes?<br1>
Is this the end?  ...<br1>
No, there is something more! I see a small flame burning bright in the ash. It is the one РІР‚вЂќ the most sacred flame of all! It is the Flame of Life, the vital energy that moves the whole world...<br1>
(O insignificant creature, would you venture to see and hear more of my mind's thoughts? You cannot! Your frail mortal frame cannot bear more of this inferno! Farewell!)
