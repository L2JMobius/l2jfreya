I will never understand the Human propensity to assign a value of right or wrong to everything, even the behavior of the gods! The worst offenders are the Priests...<br1>
There is no crime as long as we act according to our feelings, am I right?  After all, we are just the gods creations... So even if there is a crime, it is the gods' fault, not ours!<br1>
Well, I've said enough.  Please go back to <font color=LEVEL>Hermit Santiago</font>.
