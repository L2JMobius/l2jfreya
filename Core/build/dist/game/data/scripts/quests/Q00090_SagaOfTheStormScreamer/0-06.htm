The news of your success has preceded you! Congratulations!<br1>
.<br1>
What? You want the truth? Very well. What did Medina tell you? I suppose there's no harm...<br1>
I've seen too many of my treasured disciples, whom I raised with great care and devotion, fall in battle. I couldn't bear to have you, my most treasured disciple, step into the maelstrom! The more powerful you become, the more dangerous battles you'll be drawn into! That's why I tried to block your class transfer!<br1>
I sent Allector to stop you... but he failed! Finally, just as you'd reached the last stone tablet, I tried to stop you myself! But that busybody Medina got in the way, and it became impossible to carry out my plan. I should've taken you both out then!<br1>
