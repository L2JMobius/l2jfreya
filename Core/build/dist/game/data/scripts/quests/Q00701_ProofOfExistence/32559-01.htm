<html><body>War Mage Artius:<br1>
We've recently seen a drop in the morale of the soldiers of Gracia. There is a rumor that some soldiers who ventured near the Seed of Immotality saw <font color=LEVEL>something strange</font>. Perhaps it was a ghost or an evil spirit; some say they saw a beautiful woman. But when they approached it, it disappeared -- only to appear suddenly elsewhere and attack them! Now our soldiers are frightened to venture outside the Barrier Orb. Pitiful, isn't it?<br1>
Perhaps you could go out and determine the truth of these rumors. How about it? Will you help me?<br1>
