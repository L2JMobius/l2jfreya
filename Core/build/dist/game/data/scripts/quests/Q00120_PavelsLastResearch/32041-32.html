Oh, my heavens. This is a brooch from the Giant Age! And this one is especially made for Elves... no, I'm wrong, for Dwarves! The implications...<br1>
It must have been made during the Middle Age of Titans...<br1>
Please, may I buy this from you? There's not much of a market for it anywhere else, but to me it would be a treasure, and I will pay well for it. With this in my possession, the chief of the Bronze Key Guild must heed my report! What say you?<br1>
