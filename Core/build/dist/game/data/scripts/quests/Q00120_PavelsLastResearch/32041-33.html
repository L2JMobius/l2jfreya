Aagh! What is there to consider? I will give you the best price, I assure you! It can do nothing for you, and it will not sell anywhere else! No other shopkeeper would know what he was looking at and would price it as a bauble, if he offered you anything at all! If you want a keepsake of the adventure, then take what I give you in exchange and use it for a memento.<br1>
I appeal to your generosity. I need that brooch! It's the only evidence I have for anything in my report. Without it, I'll be a laughingstock.<br1>
