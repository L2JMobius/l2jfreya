<html><body>Priestess Restina:<br1>
Have you heard of the <font color=LEVEL>Garden of Eva</font>? You may occasionally find the goddess herself resting there.<br1>
She doesn't like to be disturbed, so her garden is in the deepest part of the sea, with entry gained only through an elaborate labyrinth.<br1>
Recently, <font color=LEVEL>some who wish to harm her</font> have invaded her sanctuary. She's not there at the moment, and we, her priests and guards, are trying our best to drive out the invaders. However, this task is proving more than we can handle.<br1>
We need help desperately, but I'm afraid you're not yet up to the task.<br1>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 36 or above.)
