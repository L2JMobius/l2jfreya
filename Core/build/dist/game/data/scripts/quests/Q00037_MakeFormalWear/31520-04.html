Ah, the cookies I requested! Great! It wasn't too hard, was it?<br1>
It didn't seem to give you much trouble. I've asked several people to find the materials to make the Formal Wear I promised you, but I haven't heard back from them yet. If I don't get them soon, I may not make it on time. Would you go on my behalf and find out the status of my orders?<br1>
