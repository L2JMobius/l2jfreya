You can visit many different places through the gate of time and space. The most cosmopolitan place of all is the Town of Giran!<br1>
I wasn't there for long, but I can tell you that it's a very dynamic, vibrant place. There are all sorts of people searching for adventure and romance there. The village is something of a world unto itself! You simply must visit it sometime...<br1>
