Long, long ago, Shilen placed ancient creatures on the Primeval Isle. While her power kept these dangerous beings known as dinosaurs in check, she also, in her wisdom, allowed our ancestors to govern them.<br1>
If we had more time, I could tell you fantastic tales about the ancient Elrokian warriors, whose courage and skill awed even the mighty-limbed dinosaurs.<br1>

My father always said that the first and most important duty of the Elrokian chief is to bring forth to our people the lost truth of our heritage, that we are the descendants of the Elrokians and chosen by the goddess herself. He believed we would find that proof in the Lost Nest, deep in the island's wild interior.<br1>
