OK, then... Um.<br1>
"Break the chains of race and class,<br1>
and be truly free.<br1>
Dance to the rhythm of nature,<br1>
Rejoice in the beauty of the stars.<br1>
Don't worry about tomorrow,<br1>
Enjoy small victories and learn in baby steps.<br1>
Remember, life is an illusion." These words fit you well.<br1>
