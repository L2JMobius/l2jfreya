Ah, yes! Mimir's Elixir!<br1>
This powerful potion was developed by Mimir, the greatest mage in the era of the giants... It is the source of life itself, used by the gods when they created the five races. This elixir emboldened the giants, giving them the power to create life itself and thus threatening the supremacy of the gods!<br1>
Luckily for us, our dreams are more restrained than those of the giants...<br1>
I sacrificed my youth to create this reagent. My research was the most important thing in the world to me!<br1>
