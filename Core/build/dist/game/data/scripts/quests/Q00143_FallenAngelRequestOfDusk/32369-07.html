In a way, Shilen is also a victim...<br1>
Why has Mother not used her great power to restore things to their natural order?<br1>
Why has Gran Kain, that trouble-making lover of chaos, become a father figure to the gods?<br1>
Chaos and order should not be able to co-exist... And why is the goddess of order falsely idolized by the people of chaos...<br1>
I cannot understand this.<br1>
Perhaps that is why I could not become a goddess...<br1>
