<html><body>Grand Master Tobias:<br1>
Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and the Revolutionaries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel crying for help.<br1>
She seems to be injured and fleeing something very powerful.<br1>
Now that we know where she is, we must offer what aid we can.<br1>
Go find <font color=LEVEL>Elder Casian</font> in the <font color=LEVEL>Wasteland</font> and ask him for the necessary medicine.<br1>
If you give him the Prophecy, he will be able to tell you the angel's exact location.<br1>
Then go heal her and bring me her message in an Echo Crystal.<br1>
Casian will be able to tell you more.
