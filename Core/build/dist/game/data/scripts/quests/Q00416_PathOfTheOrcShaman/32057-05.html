Ha!<br1>Well, there's no need for you to feel pain, young Orc.<br1>
From the time that Pa'agrio created you, you were supposed to be like this!<br1>
The shape of burning fire is not one and the kind of fire is not one either.<br1>
You've been cleansed with the blood of Gandi's family, now other Totem Spirits cannot ignore you... krrrr...<br1>
Now, speak with Seer Moira over there. Since you have my wisdom, he'll lead you to a Shaman.
