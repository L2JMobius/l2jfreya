<html><body>Dead Leopard's Carcass:<br1><center>
[A ghost is much like a fire:<br1>
approach it with great care,<br1>
a proper distance bear,<br1>
and grow as warm as you desire.<br1>
But stray too close to the source,<br1>
And it will eat you whole;<br1>
For ghosts and fiery coals,<br1>
Have no means to restrain their force.<br1>
Remember the teachings of Pa'agrio!<br1>
Remember the Song of Fire!<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>In order to hear the last teaching,</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Drench your hands once more with the blood of the Black Leopard!]</font></center>
