Will you join our research?  We are investigating the use of Nebulite for the greater public good.  However, we are having a hard time finding Nebulite for our study.  The Dwarven collectors we hired for this task have not been heard from in over a month.<br1>
Would you do this work for us?  Around the crater of the Ivory Tower you will find <font color=LEVEL>manashen gargoyles, enchanted monster eyes, enchanted stone golems</font>, and enchanted iron golems. They have fallen under the spell of the <font color=LEVEL>Nebulite Orbs</font>, which are fragments of the meteorite.  If you kill these monsters you can easily collect the Nebulite samples we need for our research.<br1>
You shall be well-compensated for your efforts.<br1>
