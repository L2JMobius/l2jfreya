What a miserable state I'm in, neither dead or alive, just here. What's the point? I'm an undead... No hope for me. The liqueur supplied by my students is all that keeps me going these days. I get drunk and imagine that I can feel the warmth of life flowing through my veins once again...<br1>
Oh, I suppose you are wondering how an undead can drink liqueur?  Have you heard of <font color=LEVEL>Ectoplasm Liqueur</font>? That stuff will raise a corpse from his grave to dance! It is so strong that even my old, rotten tongue twitches at its taste.  Ahhhh... What I would give for a sip right now...!<br1>
