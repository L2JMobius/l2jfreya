Please collect Nebulite Orbs and bring them to us. If you kill the <font color=LEVEL>manashen gargoyles, enchanted monster eyes, enchanted stone golems, and enchanted iron golems</font> that can be found around the crater of the Ivory Tower, you can easily obtain the Nebulite. And if you happen to run into the Dwarven collectors, remind them that they signed a Contract with us.<br1>
