Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br1>
A gem...? Ah, a Fire Emerald! It's a rare and precious gemstone that gives off a red light when exposed to sunlight.  You are very lucky!  This will fetch a very good price at market.<br1>
