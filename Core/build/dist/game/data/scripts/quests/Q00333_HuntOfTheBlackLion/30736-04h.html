Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br1>
A silver bowl and a teacup?  They seem to be of high quality!  It appears that they were made by Elven Artisans.  I don't buy such exquisite items but if you take them to a store, you should be able to sell them for a good price.<br1>
