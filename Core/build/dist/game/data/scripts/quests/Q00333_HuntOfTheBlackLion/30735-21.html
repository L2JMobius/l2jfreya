<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br1>
Why do you wish to leave the Black Lion troop?  Oh well, no need to explain yourself to me,  but heed my words...  There is no path for you but the one of the warrior.  No matter what you do or where you go you are destined for the battlefield.<br1>
Anyways, if you really want to withdraw from this Mercenary Troop, you must know this.  Once you withdraw, you must return the symbol of the Black Lion Mercenaries since you are not a Black Lion mercenary any more. Moreover, you will not be able to enjoy all the benefits given to the Black Lion Mercenaries that you've been using.  For instance, you cannot get a reward for collecting Cargo Boxes, Statues of Shilen, pieces of Fragment of Ancient Tablet, etc.  If you want to use the benefits, you will have to obtain the symbol of the Black Lion Mercenaries first. Think about it again thoroughly.<br1>
However, you will receive discharge pay according to your service.<br1>
