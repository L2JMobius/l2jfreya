<html><body>Mercenary Redfoot:<br1>
Are you looking for a job? In the northwest part of Gludio there is a farmer named Piotur who is hiring mercenaries to drive the Turek orcs away from his farm... This sounds like a good job for you, doesn't it?<br1>
By the way, are you aware that ancient relics are often found there? Many have gone there to deal with Turek orcs and come away with priceless relics!<br1>
