<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br1>
As most do.<br1>But many are not aware of a great battle that bubbles under the surface, between our order and the <font color=LEVEL>Order of Dusk</font>. We fight for control over the <font color=LEVEL>Seven Seals</font>, the seals Shunaiman himself created to fight Shilen and her armies.<br1>
These seals are now buried deep in Aden's <font color=LEVEL>catacombs and necropolises</font>, areas which have turned into hellish battlefields.<br1>
