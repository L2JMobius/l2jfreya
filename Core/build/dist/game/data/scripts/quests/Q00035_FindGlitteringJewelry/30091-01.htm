Come in! What can I do for you?<br1>
Ah, Leikar's order isn't ready yet. I'm sorry. I ordered the ore that I need to make the jewelry from Wharf Manager Felton, but he hasn't delivered it yet. Are you in a hurry? I hate to ask you this, but would you mind going to see Mr. Felton and check to see if the ore has arrived?<br1>
