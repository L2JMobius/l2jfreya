I'm sorry,we've got a problem! I was going to augment the ore so I could make a beautiful piece of jewelry, but I ran out of some materials I need! Will you help me? I can't leave the store, and there's no time to order them now.<br1>
I need <font color=LEVEL>5 Oriharukons, 500 units of silver and 150 Thons</font>. I know it's a lot, but I've got to have them! Please hurry!
