All right, this is what I need.<br1>
First, the <font color=LEVEL>teeth of the Wyrm</font> that lives in the <font color=LEVEL>Sea of Spores</font>. <font color=LEVEL>20 of them</font> should be enough.<br1>
You must also bring me the <font color=LEVEL>Leto Lizardman's amulet</font>. You can find the Leto Lizardmen in the <font color=LEVEL>southern parts of Oren</font>. You must bring me <font color=LEVEL>20 of these.</font>.<br1>
And last, I need the <font color=LEVEL>stoneheart of the enchanted stone golems</font> that may be found near the <font color=LEVEL>Ivory Tower</font>. I will need <font color=LEVEL>20 of these</font>...<br1>
These are quite a few items so I've written them down for you. Bring them to me and you shall have your jewel...
