<html><body>Leopold:<br1>
Nice to meet you, traveler. I am Leopold, Commander of the third platoon of the Black Lion mercenaries.<br1>
Our troops are as dignified and brave as any Knights on this continent. Last summer when the drakes swarmed out of Dragon Valley, we  defended Castle Giran.  A few months ago when the pirates of Avella attacked the floating city of Heine, it was the Black Lions who defeated them.<br1>
These days we are battling the Turek oak people of the northwestern part of Gludio at the request of farmer Piotur.<br1>
