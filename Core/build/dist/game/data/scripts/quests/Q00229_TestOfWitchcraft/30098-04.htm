Jewels received by Mr. Nestle... I didn't realize they were so valuable!<br1>
As I told you, the 3 jewels that I put on the auction were sold to<font color=LEVEL>Magister Iker, Trader Lara</font> and <font color=LEVEL>Dark Elven Magister Kaira</font>... You should meet them first and then ask <font color=LEVEL>Trader Nestle</font> in <font color=LEVEL>Gludin</font> about the source of the jewels.
