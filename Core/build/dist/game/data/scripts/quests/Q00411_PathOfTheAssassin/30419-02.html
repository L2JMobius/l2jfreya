I was waiting for you. Thank you for coming. It seems, one of our holy relics, <font color=LEVEL>Shilen's Tears</font> was recently stolen. I was on my way back from a pilgrimage in the north when I was attacked by a band of thieves...<br1>
I am afraid the tetrarchs will be furious, and I have not been able to return to the village for fear of them. They will not forgive me if they know that the holy relic was stolen. Please recover the stolen Shilen's Tears before the tetrarchs find out. Please help me...<br1>
