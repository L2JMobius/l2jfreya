You're full of confidence, I see. Well, that's right and proper; you have the skill to back it up. Just the sort of adventurer I need!<br1>
In the heart of the Ruins of Pavel there is a Dwarven barracks. There you will find my associate, <font color=LEVEL>Collector Yumi</font>. She will give you a job if you tell her I sent you. She's, um, a little eccentric. I'm not sure what she'll make of you, but I think you'll pass muster with her.<br1>
So, get going! Quests don't keep forever, you know!
