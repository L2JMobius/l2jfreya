<html><body>Head Blacksmith Newyear:<br1>
You have the right look, I won't argue that.<br1>
Now let's find out if you have the skills. Show me how you hold a weapon...<br1>
Hmm... I've been a blacksmith here for almost 100 years. I've seen every manner of warrior.<br1>
Your hands are too far apart, your grip is loose, and your stance is all wrong. Basically, you aren't ready.<br1>
Return here when you've learned your craft better, adventurer. I think you have the potential.<br1>
(Only characters of level 70 or above can take on this quest.)
