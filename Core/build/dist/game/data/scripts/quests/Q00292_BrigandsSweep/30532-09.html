Well done! As promised, I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins. Have you found the rest of the Suspicious Memos?<br1>
Please help me out once more, my friend! You know that you are the only one I can trust. I must find the rest of the memos and find out who is trying to destroy our Guild!<br1>
