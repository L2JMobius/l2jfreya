<html><body>Inventor Maru:<br1>
My invention? Ah, I'm flattered that you are interested! I am working on an <font color=LEVEL>"energy converter"</font>.<br1>
It transforms a common mineral into a crystal filled with powerful energy. If I am successful, I'm sure this will become as famous as the Soulshot!<br1>
I don't have enough time to review my blueprints and find all the materials I need, though... Will you help me find the materials?<br1>
I'll pay you for every mineral you bring me. Please bring as many as you can!<br1>
