This is a piece of a broken mirror. This is probably a portion of one of the bronze mirrors used by noblewomen of the Elmoreden age. Truly this is a very valuable artifact, that holds images of the lives of the ancient ones.<br1>
Thank you very much. The relics you have brought me will all be used as research material by the historical research society of the Ivory Tower. Take pride in the fact that you have played a part in revealing our forgotten past.<br1>
