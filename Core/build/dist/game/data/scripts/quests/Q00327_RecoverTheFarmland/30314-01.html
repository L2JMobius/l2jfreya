Are you the mercenary Piotur hired? What is going on over at the Orc Barracks? They say that ancient relics have recently been discovered there. Have you found any?<br1>
Old relics wouldn't be of any use to a mercenary like yourself, now would they? If you bring some of them I will give you several useful items.<br1>
What do you say? <br1>
