... The bead appears to be part of a necklace ... Yes, that is probably it. It is the jade necklace worn by magicians of the royal Elmoreden court. Truly, it is a very valuable cultural artifact that records the lives and traditions of the ancient ones.<br1>
Thank you very much. The relics you have brought me will all be used as research material by the historical research society of the Ivory Tower. Take pride in the fact that you have played a part in revealing our forgotten past.<br1>
