Ah, yes, 10 pieces. It is good that your conscience doesn't bother you about murdering angels. Others in your position have gone mad! In fact, one died yesterday by jumping into the Blazing Swamp, shouting something about being "punished by the gods"! It is good that you can keep things in perspective.<br1>

I wish I could pay you now, but "those people" I mentioned are wanting the items delivered to them first... <br1>
