When a being's thought or spirit energy comes together into the shape of a bead, we call that a Spirit Bead. Artisans like me need them to make good weapons. That's why we gamble with them -- as they're worth a lot to us. In this area, they say that you can easily get Spirit Beads if you go to <font color=LEVEL>Aden Cemetery, The Ancient Battlegrounds and the Fields of Massacre.</font><br1>
First, at <font color=LEVEL>The Cemetery</font>, you can obtain <font color=LEVEL>Spirit Beads</font> from the undead creatures known as the <font color=LEVEL>Spiteful Ghost of Ruin, Soldier of Grief, Cruel Punisher, Roving Soul, Tortured Undead and Wasted Soul.</font><br1>
Second, at <font color=LEVEL>the Ancient Battlegrounds</font>, you can obtain <font color=LEVEL>Spirit Beads</font> from the undead known as <font color=LEVEL>Past Knight, Ghostly Warrior, Hungered Corpse, the Dark Guard, Death Agent and Nihil Invader</font> and from the demons known as <font color=LEVEL>Bloody Lord, Bloody Priest, Bloody Knight and Bloody Ghost</font>.<br1>
<br1>
Lastly, at the <font color=LEVEL>Fields of Massacre,</font> you can obtain <font color=LEVEL>Spirit Beads</font> from the undead known as <font color=LEVEL>Doom Scout, Doom Servant, Doom Guard, Doom Archer, Doom Trooper, Doom Warrior, Doom Knight, Wretched Archer, Spiteful Soul Leader, Spiteful Soul Wizard and Spiteful Soul Fighter</font>.<br1>
I think that's enough information for you to get started. Is there anything else you'd like to know?<br1>
