From time to time, we enjoy a duel game called <font color=LEVEL>The Battle of Sun and Moon</font>. It's pretty popular in these parts, in case you haven't heard of it. I've found it a great way to pass the time when you're between jobs. Just say the word and I'll teach you everything you need to know. What do you say?<br1>
