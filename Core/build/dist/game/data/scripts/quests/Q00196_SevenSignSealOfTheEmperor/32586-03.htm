<html><body>Emperor Shunaiman:<br1>
The future?! So that's what they meant....<br1>
And what of my rule? Am I remembered favourably? Is the empire still inta... no. How is not the time! We will save talking for later; now we must fight to guarantee we can still draw breath by the evening's close.<br1>
Einhasad's own angel, Anakim, leads my forces against Lilith, Shilen's daughter. This is war of absolute horror, of field after field stained red with the blood of Aden's people. Yet I can see no immediate resolution...I fear that when the dust of this great conflict has settled, the victor will have naught to rule over but ruined lands and a broken people.<br1>
That is why I sought to activate the seal. But even then my path was blocked. The men I sent were each butchered, and now even I have been wounded. But you... will you help?<br1>
