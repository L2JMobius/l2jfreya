It is time to conduct our annual supply inventory, but my Marksmen are spread thin and I am needed in the field, especially with so many outsiders on the island now. Collecting a supply manifest from each shop is not particularly difficult, but it is time consuming, and I simply don't have any time to spare. Perhaps you would be willing to assist me?<br1>
