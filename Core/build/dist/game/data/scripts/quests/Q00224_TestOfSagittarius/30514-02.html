Breka Orcs! Those filthy betrayers  degrade the dignity of Orcs! They should all be sent to hell painfully!<br1>
You say that the Breka tribe has been given the serpent's egg from the devil's nest? Yes, that stands to reason as their totem was a coiled serpent...<br1>
Seer Manakia tells me that the Breka Orcs are preparing for a big ceremony right now... Perhaps the serpent's egg has something to do with it!<br1>
Please, you must go there, find out whatever you can and then kill every single <font color=LEVEL>Chief and Shaman of the Breka Orcs</font>! If you can find a <font color=LEVEL>Serpent-Shaped Charm</font>, bring it back to me.
