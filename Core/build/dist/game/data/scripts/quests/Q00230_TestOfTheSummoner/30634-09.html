First, go to <font color=LEVEL>Trader Lara in the Town of Dion</font> and have your Arcana Cards made. You cannot enter into a battle with another Summoner without one of these cards.<br1>
You must battle and defeat 6 Summoners in order to pass the Trials of the Summoner.<br1>
Do you have any other questions?<br1>
