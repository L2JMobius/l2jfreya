I have several suggestions regarding opponents - there are quite a few folks who may accept your challenge if asked.<br1>
First, you should try and contact <font color=LEVEL>Summoner Almors</font>.  He has been sick lately and is recovering on <font color=LEVEL>Talking Island</font>.<br1>
You should also try <font color=LEVEL>Summoner Basillia</font>.  I have heard that she is busy researching a new form of Summoning magic near a farm on <font color=LEVEL>the southern shores of Gludio</font>.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Summoner Camoniell</font>, of the Elves, has been in seclusion in a <font color=LEVEL>cottage in southern Dion</font>. I've heard he has had some trouble lately.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Summoner Celestiel</font> usually resides in the Ivory Tower, but has returned to <font color=LEVEL>the Elven Woods</font> on urgent business from her homeland.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Summoner Brynthea</font> and <font color=LEVEL>Summoner Belthus</font> of the Dark Elves may be proper opponents for you, but they are hard to find, as they are not likely to stay in one place. Last I heard, Brynthea was somewhere in the <font color=LEVEL>northeastern parts of Giran</font>, and Belthus was somewhere in the <font color=LEVEL>Cruma Marshlands</font>...<br1>
These Summoners are all proud and haughty people, and may scoff at a challenge from an apprentice Summoner like yourself.  But, at the same time, they will likely accept your challenge, if only to display their supremacy over you.
