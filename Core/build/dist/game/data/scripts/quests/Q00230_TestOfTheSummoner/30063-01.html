I know! You are the summons apprentice! Did you find me because you needed an arcana? I can make one for you... Although it won't be very good, it's just something I do as a pastime. It would be too embarrassing if I sold it for money.<br1>
So how about an exchange? I'll make you a Beginner's Arcana if you'll find me the goods that I need. Will that work for you?<br1>
