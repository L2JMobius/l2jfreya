The Arcana Card is engraved with the Summoner's name and a unique mark. Most Summoners are highly competitive and wish to show off their victories. Thus, the tradition of Arcana Cards began.<br1>
As an apprentice, you may begin a battle only after a higher level Summoner has given you a card. <font color=LEVEL>If you do not have an apprentice Arcana Card, the opponent will not accept your challenge.</font> You must give your opponent an Arcana Card each time you are defeated, so I suggest that you have a good supply of cards created before hand.<br1>
If you are victorious you will receive your opponent's card. It is easy to see who a Summoner has defeated by looking at his or her Arcana Card collection.<br1>
In the past, Summoners created their own cards, but now the cards are much more sophisticated and must be created by special Craftsmen.<br1>
