<html><body>Attribute Master Yang:<br1>
You succeeded! Thank you.<br1>
I'd like to give you something as a reward, but all that I have here are my research notes about attributes. Hmm... I can give you an Attribute Ore. It has value, so you won't regret acccepting it.<br1>
Since you have completed my request twice, I'll give you 2 Ores reflecting the attribute of your choosing. Now, which ones do you want?<br1>
