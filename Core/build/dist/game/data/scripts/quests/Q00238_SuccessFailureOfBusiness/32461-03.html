Alright. If you go near the Purified Ceremony Hall, something called <font color=LEVEL>Purified Magic Square</font> is raised everywhere.<br1>
This Magic Square is almost like a symbol for that Purified Ceremony Hall. In addition, that Magic Square disillusions Mucrokians who are interfering in our project, and thus makes them fiercely violent.<br1>
Please hurry and get rid of those awful Magic Squares. Bring me <font color=LEVEL>10 broken Magic Square fragments</font> as evidence.
