<html><body>Flame Lord Kakai:<br1>
I, Hestui leader Kakai, will oversee your test. Take this necklace and <font color=LEVEL>visit the other 5 tribe leaders and be acknowledged as a lord</font>. As a proof of their acknowledgement, bring back <font color=LEVEL>the totem of each tribe</font>!<br1>
If you bring back all 5 tribes' totems, I will personally test you to see if you are really qualified to be a lord!<br1>
And take this <font color=LEVEL>Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.<br1>
