Tejakar Pa'agrio! Praise the Lord of the Flame! I see by the necklace you are wearing that you are a Sorcerer undergoing the Test of the Lord! I, Tantus, undefeated Chief of the Neruga tribe shall teach you...<br1>
The bond that ties all tribes and kinships together is not blood but the singular consciousness of our entire race! This common mind is symbolized by the totem of each tribe. Once you have an understanding of the totem of the Warriors of Neruga, I will acknowledge you as a Monarch! Now you must find the materials that compose the Neruga tribal totem!<br1>
