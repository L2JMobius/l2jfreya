What brings you here? Ah, Leikar sent you? The Sewing kit she ordered, eh? I was just about to start on it. I'll just be a moment...<br1>
I must have some scraps of Steel somewhere around here...<br1>
Hmm... I must've used it all up!<br1>
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. I'm out of materials.<br1>
