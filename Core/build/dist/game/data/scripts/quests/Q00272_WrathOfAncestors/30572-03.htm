<html><body>Seer Livina:<br1>
Tejakar Oroka! Young Orc, you have been guided to me by the spirits of our ancestors. As you already know, since they have moved in here while we were at war against the Elves, the goblins have been damaging the legacy of our ancestors and have been staining our sacred grounds for hundreds of years.<br1>
Just few days ago, reckless <font color=LEVEL>goblin grave robbers</font> dug up the great Urutu graves and committed sacrilege! Because of this incident, the spirits of our ancestors were furious and appear in our dreams every night, shouting for revenge in blood.<br1>
The only way to ease their anger is to behead those disrespectful grave robbers and offer them to the ancestors. I order you as a seer. Go, young Orc! Go punish the goblins and burn their village! Show no mercy to those who dug up our ancestors' graves!<br1>
