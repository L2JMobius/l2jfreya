Tejakar Oroka! Young Orc who fights for the dignity of your race, you must pacify the fury of the ancestors and renew the honor of the Orcs by killing each and every goblin that lives in this land.<br1>
But first, we must make a sacrifice for our ancestors to soothe their spirits! To do that, we need to behead those who dug up the graves. To satisfy our ancestors, we should behead at least <font color=LEVEL>fifty grave robbers</font>. So go to the wilderness and kill all the <font color=LEVEL>goblin grave robbers</font> you see!
