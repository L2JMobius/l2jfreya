<html><body>Father Gupu:<br1>
Ah, It seems you are talking about Kristina... But you're too late! She was recently kidnapped by some strange men that broke into the orphanage!<br1>
Curse the fiends! What is this world coming to! And what have they done with <font color=LEVEL>Windy</font>? No no, Ari, father is not mad!<br1>
After Kristina's kidnapping, the Elf masters of the Town of Gludio came to help search for her, and now you. And all of them ignoring the fact that the orphanage is in ruins and the children are starving! If only I had <font color=LEVEL>100,000 Adena</font>, I would be able to buy beds for these children...<br1>
