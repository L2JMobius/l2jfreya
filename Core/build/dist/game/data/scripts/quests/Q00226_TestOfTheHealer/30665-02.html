<html><body>Saint Kristina:<br1>
I overheard the Dark Elf who kidnapped me say that the goddess is waking up, although I do not know what that means.<br1>
But I know one thing for sure, it was my destiny to be kidnapped and brought here...<br1>
I will stay here. The time has not yet come for my return to the shrine. It is now my duty to spread the word of light in this forest of darkness. The Dark Elves deserve to know the truth of Einhasad. To survive the Chaotic Chronicle we must all join together.<br1>
Please take this letter to <font color=LEVEL>Master Sorius</font>.
