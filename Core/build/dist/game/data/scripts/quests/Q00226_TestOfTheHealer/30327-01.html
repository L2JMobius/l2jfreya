I have heard from Priest Bandellos. We will help in any way we can in your investigation.<br1>
What we know so far is that it seems that the followers of Shilen kidnapped the girl. Meet the Dwarf called <font color=LEVEL>Daurin Hammercrush</font> in the <font color=LEVEL>northwest part of Turek Orc Barracks</font>. He is our spy who set off ahead of us.
