Welcome back! You got the <font color=LEVEL>bait of chill</font> before.<br1>
You really did a number on those bandits! They're not all gone, however. Was the bait useful?<br1>
It's not designed to catch fish, but has another, more valuable power!<br1>
Did you catch anything? That bait was designed to catch something besides fish, by the way! If your fishing skill is level 12, you definitely should catch something with it! Have you found anything?<br1>
