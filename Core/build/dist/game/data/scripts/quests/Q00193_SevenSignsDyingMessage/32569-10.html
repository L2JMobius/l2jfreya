<html><body>Priest Cain:<br1>
Dwarves have been able to inscribe weapons and armor with incantations, friend--their skills with metals are unrivalled throughout Aden.<br1>
But what if Jacob were inscribe his necklace with something other than an incantation? What if he left a message within his necklace as he lay dying? A message that would pinpoint his killer?<br1>
It seems that somehow that creature was able to hide itself in the message, and when the necklace touched the burning incense... we must have released it.<br1>
