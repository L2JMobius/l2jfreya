Now can I do for you, eh? I'm Eric, master gatherer and general do-gooder. Yessir, need something found, just come to me. Need something killed, then... go to someone else. Heh.<br1>
Oh lord... you've only gone and made me forget what I was lookin' for, haven't you? I wonder if I still have that letter on me....<br1>
