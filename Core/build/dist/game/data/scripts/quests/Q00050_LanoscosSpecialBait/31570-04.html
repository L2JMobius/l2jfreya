Thanks for your help. I can't get around to get the materials I need like I used to... Now I'll make the <font color=LEVEL>bait of wind</font> for you. I use the repulsive power between the elements of water and wind. Just as water and air don't mix, things that are underwater begin to float.<br1>
Now, give me the <font color=LEVEL>100 essences of wind</font>!<br1>
