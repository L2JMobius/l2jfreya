Thank you, youngster. So, from now on I want you to listen carefully to what I say.<br1>
Take this letter that I give you to <font color=LEVEL>Blacksmith Pinter in the town of Gludio</font>. If you give him the letter, he will give you something. Bring that back to me. What do you think? It's very easy, isn't it?<br1>
Now that you know, depart quickly! Every moment is critical!
