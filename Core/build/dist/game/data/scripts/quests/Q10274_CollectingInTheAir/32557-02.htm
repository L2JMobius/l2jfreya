Do you know what powers the Airships? It's ancient Giant technology. But you need <font color=LEVEL>Star Stones</font> to power, maintain and repair a Airship. They can only be found in the skies of Gracia. It's not easy to collect these stones, especially since they tend to attract some rather nasty monsters. But don't you think they're worth the risk, given their rarity and value?<br1>
I think you've got all the makings of a fine Star Stone collector, actually. What do you say? Will you do it?<br1>
