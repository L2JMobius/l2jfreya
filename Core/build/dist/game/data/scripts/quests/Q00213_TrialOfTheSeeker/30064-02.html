Well... I guess I have no choice. I have been curious about the increase in  those mutations... But first you must do me a favor. I will need some time to revive Hawkeye. In the meantime, I need you to do some planning and scout the area.<br1>
We need a rough Map of the monsters' mutations. You must capture one and bring it to me. We will make our next move according to what we find.<br1>
