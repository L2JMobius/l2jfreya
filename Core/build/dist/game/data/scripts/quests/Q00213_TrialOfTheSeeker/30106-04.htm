For now, the guild has decided to keep our investigation of this matter secret. For that we must have the aid of guild members skilled in concealment and scouting, like yourself. Of course, you must also be able to defend yourself in dangerous situations. Conflict with the mutants will be unavoidable... I must warn you, your life will be at great risk.<br1>
But such is the life of a Scout. This is a great opportunity to prove your skills... Will you lend us your aid?<br1>
