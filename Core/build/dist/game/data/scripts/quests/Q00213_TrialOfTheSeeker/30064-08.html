I hope your investigation is going well? Time is short so you must hurry. Do you remember your task? You must hunt <font color=LEVEL>Ol Mahum Captains</font>, <font color=LEVEL>Turek Orc Warlords</font>, <font color=LEVEL>Ant Captain</font>, and <font color=LEVEL>Turak Bugbear Warriors</font>... Catch them and collect the bezoars from their bodies.<br1>
I am not sure if it is due to the bezoars, but they are behaving very <font color=LEVEL>aggressively</font>. Please, be careful.<br1>
