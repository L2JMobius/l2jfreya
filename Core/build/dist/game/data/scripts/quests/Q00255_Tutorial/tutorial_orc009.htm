From now on, you will receive the benefits of being a <font color=LEVEL>New Character</font>. <br1>Until you reach level 25, you will receive the following advantages:<br1>
1. Equipment exchange:<br1>
You can trade your current weapon or armor for higher quality equipment, paying only the difference in price. In order to initiate the trade, start a conversation with any merchant at a weapons or armor shop.<br1>
2. Support magic:<br1>You may ask a Newbie Guide to cast Support Magic on you, which can be very helpful when fighting monsters. You may receive Support Magic after level 6, with support up to level 62.<br1>
3. Additional Supplies of Soulshot and Spiritshot.<br1>
Each time you complete a particular quest as a newbie, you will also receive an additional reward. Go and speak with <font color=LEVEL>Atuba Chief Varkees</font> who can be found in the King's Hall within the Orc Village. She will give you the details of a quest to defeat Rakeclaw Imps.<br1>
If you complete this quest, you will receive additional <font color=LEVEL>Soulshot or Spiritshot that are meant for beginners</font>.<br1>
