Why haven't you left yet? As I said before, seek out <font color=LEVEL>Mucrokian Fanatics, Mucrokian Ascetics, Mucrokian Saviors, Mucrokian Preachers, Awakened Mucrokians and Contaminated Mucrokians</font>. Tear off the hide of each one you kill and bring them back to me. You can find these ghastly beasts between the Fields of Silence and the Field of Whispers.<br1>
Now hurry!
