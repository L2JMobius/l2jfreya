I've heard that you are ready to enter Nornil's Cave.<br1>
That means that the time is also drawing near for you to leave this island. Well, they say that the mainland is also filled with adventure.<br1>
Before you leave, though, would you do me a small favor by retrieving something for me from Nornil's Cave?<br1>
