Argh! May your beard become as sparse as a Gremlin's whiskers, you empty-headed wastrel! You are as forgetful as Brunon...<br1>
First, stop by the Weapons and Armor Shop and get a sack of Boom-boom Powder from <font color=LEVEL>Trader Shari</font>.<br1>
Then go to the General Store and get a pair of Mining Boots from <font color=LEVEL>Trader Garita</font>.<br1>
After that, go to the Warehouse and get us a case of Redstone Beer from <font color=LEVEL>Warehouse Chief Reed</font>.<br1>
Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from <font color=LEVEL>Blacksmith Brunon</font>.
