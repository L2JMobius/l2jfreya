Oh, is that right? I have sensed the energy emmitted by Sailren had become stronger these later days and wondered if this ancient evil was simply waiting for its chance to strike.<br1>

Now, with your arrival here, I think our gracious mother has answered our prayers. It may be possible now to defeat it.<br1>
