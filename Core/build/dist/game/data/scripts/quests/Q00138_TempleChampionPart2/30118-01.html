Greetings, adventurer who carries out the mission of the Temple!<br1>
Do you wish to meet Preacher Sla?<br1>
As you know, the preachers' goals differ somewhat from the goals of the Temple priests.<br1>
Preachers believe that the Temple's rigid rules and ceremonies often serve as a barrier to a true understanding of and relationship with the goddess.<br1>
And given the Temple's close association with the aristocracy, many preachers are critical that the priests are more concerned with personal status and wealth than true service.<br1>
