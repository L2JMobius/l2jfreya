(Tell him that you met Preacher Sla and gave him the manifesto, and have returned with a message from him.)<br1>
Only a strong and unified Temple can bring peace to this continent, and only concentrated power can protect the people.<br1>
Besides, the angel of Einhasad has obviously come down to empower us in our holy mission. What else would it mean?<br1>
But even with this clear evidence, I see they will not accept the truth. I just do not understand them...<br1>
We are now attempting to determine the angel's exact whereabouts.<br1>
Once we contact the angel, surely even the apostates must accept our authority.<br1>
