Ah, the Limbs of the Temple...<br1>
...<br1>
We wish to distribute our manifesto -- which argues that the advent of the angel proves the Temple's legitimacy and authority -- to the various breakaway groups.<br1>
This will give them a final chance to repent of their apostasy and return to our loving fold, and in so doing escape eternal punishment.<br1>
But it will be very difficult to disseminate the manifesto to each group -- many lie in dangerous areas and many more will suspect a trick and refuse to meet with any representative we send...<br1>
However, an experienced adventurer might be able to both reach these groups and convince them to hear him out.<br1>
Will you help us?<br1>
