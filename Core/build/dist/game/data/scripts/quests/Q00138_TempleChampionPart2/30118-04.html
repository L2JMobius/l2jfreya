<font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Angus in the Town of Giran</font> is charged with the raising of Dark Elves.<br1>
We have heard word that one of the Dark Elven trainees was involved in a serious accident.<br1>
I think Angus may need help to deal with it. I will ask him for more information, but I must warn you that in rendering him aid you will almost certainly be violating the rules of your order.<br1>
Angus knows Preacher Sla well, however, and if you help him I am sure that he will write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.<br1>Knowing that you may be asked to break the Temple code, do you still want to undertake this task?<br1>
