<html><body>Seer Reva:<br1>
Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word has come that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels and demons.  I trust that you have recovered many of the <font color=LEVEL>Ancient Ash Urns</font> from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders!<br1>
The <font color=LEVEL>Ancient Porcelain</font> you brought doesn't contain any remains. It was only used for decoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Either sell it at a store or take it to <font color=LEVEL>antique dealer Patrin</font>! He is at the general store in the Town of Oren.<br1>
