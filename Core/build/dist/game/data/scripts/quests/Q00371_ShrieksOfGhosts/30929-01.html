<html><body>Antique Dealer Patrin:<br1>
It has come to my attention that the Orc seer Reva of the Town of Aden is collecting Ancient Ash Urns. I asked him to give them to me so that I could sell them for a handsome price to antique collectors. He refused my offer, insisting that he needed them for a ritual! He promised me that if he finds an urn that does not contain any remains he would send it to me. Have you brought me such an item?<br1>
