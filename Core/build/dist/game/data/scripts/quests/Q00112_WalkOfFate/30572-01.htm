Come in! I've been waiting for you.<br1>
I knew you were coming! It's the will of Pa'agrio. You won't feel it, but I can feel a very positive energy from far beyond the eastern horizon! Could you check out what's going on over there? I know I'm being vague like most psychics are, but please trust me.<br1>
