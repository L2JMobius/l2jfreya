<html><body>Unidentifiable Body:<br1>
You see the mauled body of a Dwarf. Although the lack of decay indicates recent death, the body is too damaged to easily identify who it was.<br1>
(Only characters who are above level 79 and in the process of the Seven Signs and Series of Unknown Deaths quests may undertake this quest.)
