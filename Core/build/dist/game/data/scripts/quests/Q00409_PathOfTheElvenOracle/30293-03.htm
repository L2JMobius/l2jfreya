Thank you for your offer, but I am afraid that this mission might prove too difficult for you. Come back when you have experienced more of the world. Then we will be able to speak at greater length.<br1>
May your journey be a blessed one!<br1>
(Only characters level 18 or above may embark on this quest.)
