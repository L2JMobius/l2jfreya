In this place, I can help you overcome the limitations that you feel.<br1>
Our three heroes waited for you, even though they were chased by the goddess, in order to reveal the secret of our creation to you...<br1>
But in order to exceed your limitations, you must first know your limitations. That was why you met Katenar, and later Harkilgamed.<br1>
But what will happen when you finally break free of those limitations? Kekropus told you the story of the Humans in order to show you the answer.<br1>
Now I will grant you a new power.<br1>
