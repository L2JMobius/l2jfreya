Ah...<br1>
If only time permitted, I would like to tell you everything...<br1>
But it does not, unfortunately, and even now time is growing short. Are you familiar with the word "<font color=LEVEL>Spicula</font>?" Go ask one of my brethren, <font color=LEVEL>Harkilgamed</font> about it and listen to his reply...<br1>
I can speak no more -- I must disappear now. Remember: <font color=LEVEL>Spicula Kamael</font>.<br1>
You will find Harkilgamed hiding in the <font color=LEVEL>Valley of Saints</font>.<br1>
