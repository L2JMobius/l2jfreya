Great one...<br1>
I remember your parents.<br1>
I remember your birth.<br1>
I remember when you left these shores for the Outer World.<br1>
And I remember when you returned to this island of ours.<br1>
Many before you refused to walk this path.<br1>
But you are unafraid to step boldy into the dangerous and unclear future. Truly you are Kamael of the Kamael!<br1>
