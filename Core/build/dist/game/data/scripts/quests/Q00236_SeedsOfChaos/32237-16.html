It may be possible to escape fate, but it is impossible to escape the rules of this world.<br1>
Although we were able to stimulate the Seed of Chaos, unfortunately you cannot take the powers of the other races that were created by the gods. Even so, you will be able to walk the path of the other Kamael that you could not before.<br1>
