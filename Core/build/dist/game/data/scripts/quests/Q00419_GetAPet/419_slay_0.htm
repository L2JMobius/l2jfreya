Let's see...There are so many of them...<br1>
Ah, you are from Talking Island right? 
In that case, go to your hometown and take care of the animal slaughters there.
How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it?<br1>
The monsters on Talking Island are<font color=LEVEL>the giant spiders, talon spiders, 
and blade spiders</font>. 
They are the most wicked animal slaughterers on Talking Island. 
They say that they devour the animals every day. There are hardly any animals 
left near where they live.<br1>Therefore you should go and get rid of them. 
By the way, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that you 
killed the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come back with 
nothing to prove your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!</body></html>
