<html><body>Master Chef Donath:<br1>
 Ah, the legendary last meal of Duelists!<br1>
 Is it for you? The last dish...<br1>
 Did you know that dish actually contains the resolve one feels before going into mortal combat?<br1>
And, of course, the ingredients must be gathered by the Duelist himself. Consuming food gathered at great risk allows the warrior to absorb the power of his opponent!<br1>
If the meal is for you, you should collect and bring back the ingredients by yourself!<br1>
