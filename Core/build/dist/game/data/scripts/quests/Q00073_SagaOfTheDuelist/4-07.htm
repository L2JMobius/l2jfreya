Humph! He got away!<br1>
Oh well, let me introduce myself. I'm Kain. Don't worry about my last name! I forgot it years ago!<br1>
Did you hear what that guy was saying? All that rubbish about eternal life, blah blah blah! Don't be manipulated by such gibberish! Well, if you want to believe that garbage, go right ahead, but all that will be left of you will be rotting flesh and maggots! Ha!<br1>
I met a guy once named Swordsmaster Iron who believed all that crap! I just ignored him... Have you met him?<br1>
