<body>Devil's Isle Supporter:<br1>
This sword is an ancient relic of Devil's Isle. It was used to destroy those who fell under the curse.<br1>
Fearing its power, they were finally able to weaken it by sealing away a few of its powers in a number of scrolls.<br1>
As you use it to defeat our enemies, though, you'll acquire the ability to enhance the weapon to its former strength.<br1>
You should know that there are several Dwarven adventurers also trapped on the island. Take the sword and a Scroll of Enchant Weapon to one of them and they'll make your weapon even more powerful!<br1>
