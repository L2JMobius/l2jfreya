Chaos... That's right. That's the best word I can use to describe it...<br1>
It was like something ripped a hole in reality itself. Both captain and crew were sucked in...<br1>
I later heard that that power is called Kamaloka or Pailaka or somesuch. They say that it will engulf the entire world.<br1>
That's when my nightmares came... Soon after closing my eyes, I dream of strange and horrible monsters who torture me until I wake again. Ah, but the real problem was something else... Do you know what it is?<br1>
