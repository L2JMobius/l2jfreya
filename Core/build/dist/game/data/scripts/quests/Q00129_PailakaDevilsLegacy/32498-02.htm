Uh... I suppose I can talk about Lematan's Fleet with someone of your skill and experience...<br1>
Lematan was a pirate who lusted after Zaken's treasure... But instead of making him rich, it brought him only evil.<br1>
As soon as he touched the treasure, a powerful curse was cast about Lematan. He and his men were transformed into something...indescribable.<br1>
And that wasn't the end of it. An unnatural darkness, blacker than black, suddenly arose and swallowed them all. It was like looking into the pit of chaos itself...<br1>
