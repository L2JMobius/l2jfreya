<html><body>High Priestess Innocentin:<br1>
Today's silver spears are dedicated to the people who worked hard to suppress the rebellion. One is for the protectors of the royal family, who captured and punished the rebels, and one is for those who fought against the undead and captured the demon's followers... and it will therefore be a dedication that upholds the false accusations against our former priests.<br1>
The one responsible for all this is staying at the temple in Rune Castle Town.<br1>
Please don't ask any more questions. Just take the records that he left behind, and find out where that key fits.
