<html><body>Ghost of von Hellmann:<br1>
This concerns Lidia's Diary? Is that right? Oh, I see! Dear traveler! For whatever little time I have left, I'll read this diary and go over the past again and again in my mind!<br1>
Traveler, I shall reward you well for this diary! Dig underneath this tombstone and you will find my key!<br1>
Take that key to the Chamberlain of the Hellmann Family! You'll find him <font color=LEVEL>in the village hidden in the middle of this forest</font>!
