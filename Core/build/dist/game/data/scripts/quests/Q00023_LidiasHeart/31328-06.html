According to a custom from the Elmoreden period, a Silver Spear was the symbol of the family responsible for guarding the royal family.<br1>
An ancient proverb says, <font color=LEVEL>"A jeweled scepter for the mighty King of Elmore and two Silver Spears for his protectors"</font>.<br1>
I'll wager that somewhere is a lock that matches this key...<br1>
