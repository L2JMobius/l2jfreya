<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br1>
You must know that all dwarves such as I are union members. Dwarven society is extremely competitive by definition and their unions are even more so.<br1>
You must not think that just because we are always smiling that being a union member is an easy life. In or out of the union, life for a Dwarf is a never-ending struggle for survival.<br1>
(Quest for Dwarves of level 37 and above.)
