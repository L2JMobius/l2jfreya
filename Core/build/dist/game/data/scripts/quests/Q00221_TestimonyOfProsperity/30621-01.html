So, you were sent by the guild! We have been looking forward to meeting you! If you're ready I'll get right down to business.<br1>
A week ago, I went into the tower alone to do research. I admit it was a dangerous thing to do, since field investigations are not my specialty. During the search I found a very old, <font color=LEVEL>tightly locked box</font>. The box appeared to be constructed of a material not of this earth.<br1>
