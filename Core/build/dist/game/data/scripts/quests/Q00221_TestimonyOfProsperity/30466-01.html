Ah, The Great Mother...? Yes, that is how my mother is known. She greatly deserves the title. She raised 12 children on her own.  My father died before I was born. I was the last born child, and a posthumous one at that.<br1>
My mother had no time to grieve my father's death and worked hard to raise us well. She had no rest until I was grown. Now that I have grown and settled down I can finally provide for my her.<br1>
Would you like to meet her? She is probably at home right now... She is a bit shy around strangers... Lately she has been depressed and moody. I am sure she misses my father... I try to comfort her, but it is easier said than done...<br1>
