Yes, I know I need to pay my <font color=LEVEL>dues</font>. But...well, my sales are way down lately. What can I do? I can't very well pay if I don't have the money, can I?<br1>
I suppose I could borrow the money... In fact, I just took out a loan I was hoping to use to buy some new inventory. Oh, well...take it! Just take it and go!<br1>
Now I don't know how I'm going to keep my store open...
