You wish to become a Scavenger? How commendable of you! There should be more bright youngsters like yourself, but they are all too rare ... What good is an Artisan anyway? All you do is work your back off under someone else all your life. When would you even touch a stuffed money pouch? Tsk, tsk ...<br1>
Compared to that, if you become a Scavenger you can enjoy a successful life in your later years, just like me, if you're willing to put up with just a little trouble in your youth. You have made an excellent choice. Well then, shall I tell you how to become a Scavenger?<br1>
