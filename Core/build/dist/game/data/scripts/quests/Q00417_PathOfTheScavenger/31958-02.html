Ah ha!  That must be it! If Master Toma sent you, then that must be it!<br1>
You came here to become a Scavenger, right?<br1>
If you've met Toma and carried out his work, then I think I can trust you.<br1>
Here, I'll give you this.  Take it to <font color=LEVEL>Warehouse Chief Alder</font> over there. He'll test your talent and transfer you to the Scavenger class.
