<html><body>Atuba Chief Varkees:<br1>
The almighty Flame Lord has ordered me to wipe those disgusting <font color=LEVEL>Rakeclaw Imps</font> from the face of the earth! Have you ever encountered those disgusting creatures? They are an abomination! Spawned from the blackest magic, their very existence defiles our sacred lands.<br1>
But they are too cowardly to face us alone -- there must be someone or something else controlling them. According to our seers, a jeweled <font color=LEVEL>Soulstone</font> is embedded in each of their black hearts. This Soulstone enslaves its victim to the will of another.<br1>
The seers also believe that if we gather enough Soulstones, we will be able to turn their own powers against them and discover who is controlling the Imps. I therefore charge you with the task of slaying these filthy Imps and bringing me the Soulstones embedded in their hearts!<br1>
