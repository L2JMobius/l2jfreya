I must have the scrolls in order to help you...<br1>
Lucas's mention of the fortune-teller reminds me of something... I know an astrologer who is an old friend of my family. I haven't seen her since the peasant's uprising...<br1>
Her name is <font color=LEVEL>Creta the Astrologer</font>. You should be able to find her in <font color=LEVEL>Floran Village</font>.<br1>
Take her this letter.  I think she may be able to help us... Please.
