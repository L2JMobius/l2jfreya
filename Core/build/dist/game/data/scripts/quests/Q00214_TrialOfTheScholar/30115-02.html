Not long after I arrived in Giran frightening monsters began to gather in the corridor to the north. During this time I learned that the creatures using magic were not originally magic users.<br1>
I can't be sure, but I sense the complicity of Dark Magician Hardin. As you know, his school is nearby.<br1>
I can't imagine why, but I am quite sure that it is he who gave these monsters the ability to use magic. I have no evidence of this crime, and the suspicions seem to be mine alone.<br1>
I intend to investigate, starting with the monsters that use magic. What do you say? Will you assist with my investigation?<br1>
