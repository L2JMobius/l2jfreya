<html><body>Magister Mirien:<br1>
You've brought the Symbol of Cronos! Did you have any trouble? I have to admit, I wondered if you could do it. Please don't take any offense at that -- it's no reflection on your ability, simply the difficulty of the task.<br1>
But with all sincerity, please accept my congratulations. You have passed the Trial of the Scholar and are now one step closer to achieving a higher level of wisdom and knowledge. Take this <font color=LEVEL>Mark of Scholar</font>. You will need it when you transfer to a higher class. May the Goddess protect and keep you. Farewell!
