Ah, the Crystal of Purity!  Behold the beauty of the most pure formation!<br1>
To tell you the truth, I knew that Maria wasn't quite ready to make the crystal and I thought that you might help her find the way.<br1>
Thanks to you, the method of creating this crystal has been restored to us, and we have the object we need to purify the Execution Grounds. Good work.<br1>
You shall have the mark as promised. Take it to <font color=LEVEL>Magister Mirien</font> over there. Good luck in the Trial of the Scholar.
