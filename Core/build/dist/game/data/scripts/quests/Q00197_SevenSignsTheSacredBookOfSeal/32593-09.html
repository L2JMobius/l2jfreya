Oh my... I wonder if it was after you...or the sacred text?<br1>
Well, that settles it. Give me that manuscript and the object you found and I'll keep them safe. You must be exhausted! Rest for a while. When you've refreshed yourself, then come back and see me.<br1>
By then, perhaps Franz will be back as well.
