You already have the Mark of the Pagan, so you don't need to hear this story again.<br1>
Oh, by the way, a little remind for you: Although you realized your own frailty and brought your combined might can do anything to stop us. Lord Triol was quite aware of the danger a party of adventurers might present, so he <font color=LEVEL>cast a spell that will scatter an invading party to the winds.</font> So don't waste your time fighting us - you'll never prevail.<br1>
(If a party of six or more fight inside the Pagan Temple, there is a chance that some of the party members will be teleported elsewhere.)
