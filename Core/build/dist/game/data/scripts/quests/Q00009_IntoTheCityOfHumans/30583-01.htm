I am devoted to the subject of power! Specifically, what is the most powerful thing in the world?<br1>
Of course, dragons are quite formidable! But there is a beast who can subjugate even the mightiest of dragons! They are called Humans. We creatures of Pa'agrio are familiar with this scourge... It was they who defeated us in battle and exiled us to this Immortal Plateau!<br1>
But what is the source of their victory? Are they really more powerful than the mighty Orc?<br1>
But I, Centurion Petukai, guard the great Flame Lord Kakai! I can't investigate this myself...<br1>
Young Orc! Find the answer for me!<br1>
