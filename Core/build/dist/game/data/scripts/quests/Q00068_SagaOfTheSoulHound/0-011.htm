<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br1>
Because I knew that you would come to me, I want to tell you about a question that will appear 
at the end of the road that you intend to travel. I suspect that once you hear what I have to say 
the answer will become plain. We Kamael re-entered this world with certain limitations, since the 
power we potentially wield may have a profound and lasting impact on all the races. A portion of 
that power was sealed to prevent its misuse. But those who prove themselves worth may still 
unlock that power within themselves...<br1>
