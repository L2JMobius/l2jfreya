Well done! You have learned the basic operations of the game. Now you can really enjoy the adventure.<br1>
To assist you in your journeys, take this gift. I presume you already heard the explanation about how to use it? <br1>
You now have a decision to make. Will you develop your skills in the Orc Village? Or will you raise your abilities by going among the Kamael on the Isle of Souls? Tell me what you decide.<br1>
