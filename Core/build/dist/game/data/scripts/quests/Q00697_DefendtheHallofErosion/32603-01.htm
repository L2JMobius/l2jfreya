After several attempts, each area was finally <font color=LEVEL>stabilized</font> once we occupied the <font color=LEVEL>Seed of Infinity</font>. But now the power of Ekimus is again growing, and the undead have again begun to awaken.<br1>
Our scouts think they will soon attack the <font color=LEVEL>Hall of Erosion</font> once they have secured the Hall of Suffering. If this area falls, the whole Seed will again fall under Ekimus' influence. That must not be allowed to happen.<br1>
We need volunteers to help <font color=LEVEL>defend the Hall of Erosion</font>. Will you join them?<br1>
