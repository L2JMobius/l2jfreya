<html><body>Seer Somak:<br1>
A Warcryer is a supreme level Mystic who deals with the war spirits! Their fierce roar makes our soldiers burn with combativeness and dooms the enemies! Their hymn inspires our troop's morale and freezes the heart of our enemies!<br1>
Thou, Shaman of Orc! If you truly wish to be Warcryer, you can't avoid the War Spirit's Trial! However, I, Seer Somak say! You are still unprepared!<br1>
(Quest for Orc Shaman characters of level 39 and above.)
