<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br1>
Greetings, young traveler. I am Duelist Kaien.<br1>
The original meaning of the word 'Duelist' was 'Challenger.' It was used to describe those who exhibited their dazzling talents in the arena at Schuttgart. They bathed in the blood of their rivals and regarded that as an honor.<br1>
Now this title is given to those whose skills with the weapon have reached their zenith. It is an honor desired by all that wield a weapon, but only a select few may attain this title, and only after many years of training...<br1>
I see that you do not walk the path of the sword. I am sure you don't understand the thrill of combat in which 2 swords meet. You will never be a Duelist.<br1>
(This quest may only be performed by Warriors, Elven Knights, Palus Knights, and Orc Monks with level 39 and higher.)
