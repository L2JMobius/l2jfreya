<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br1>
I personally selected your opponents for the trial in <font color=LEVEL>Oren</font>. First you shall fight the <font color=LEVEL>Leto Lizardman overlord</font> that lives in the southern regions of Oren, and your second opponent will be the <font color=LEVEL>enchanted monster eye</font> that wanders the area surrounding the Ivory Tower of Oren. Stay alert, as both are formidable enemies!<br1>
Bring back 10 Leto Lizardman Amulets, and 10 pieces of Enchanted Eye Meat.<br1>
