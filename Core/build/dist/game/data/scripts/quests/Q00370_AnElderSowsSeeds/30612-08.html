Let's see, the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind, and the Chapter of Earth... you have brought them all! Perhaps your discovery will lead to a way to restore this ruined place. At last I shall be redeemed... This is all thanks to you. Please accept this humble token of my appreciation.<br1>
But this sad chapter is not yet complete... The dark magic that caused this disaster had many sources, united in their power and holding copies of "Kranvel's Spellbook"!<br1>
Alas, it's true! There remain many pieces of that horrid tome scattered about the inside of the Ant Nest. If I am to continue my research, and above all to keep this dreadful power from falling into the wrong hands, the remaining fragments of "Kranvel's Spellbook" must be recovered! Please help!<br1>
