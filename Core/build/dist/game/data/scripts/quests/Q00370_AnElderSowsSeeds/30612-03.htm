Ironically, the deformed beasts around us hold the clues to finding the legacy of Kranvel. Giant ants are known to pick up anything they find and take it to their nests. It is said that they have collected a great number of ancient relics and taken them to their nest in the maze-like caves beneath the wasteland.<br1>
You will most likely find the pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" in the <font color=LEVEL>Ant Nest</font>. You mustn't attempt this alone! Take some reliable colleagues along with you.<br1>
