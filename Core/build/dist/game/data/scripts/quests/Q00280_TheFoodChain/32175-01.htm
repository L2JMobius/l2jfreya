For some reason, we have recently noticed an increase in numbers of grey keltir and black wolves near the village entrance...<br1>
By themselves, they are hardly a threat, but we are concerned that more dangerous predators will be drawn to the area as well. That is why we must hunt the grey keltir and black wolves now. Unfortunately, my time is taken up with other important tasks...<br1>
I hesitate to ask, but would you be willing to help me?<br1>
