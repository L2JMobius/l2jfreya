We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should go to <font color=LEVEL>Guild Member Tor</font> to find out what requests have currently come in. If there is an assignment that appeals to you, you can accept it.<br1>There are also individuals who wish to hire hunters. Recently <font color=LEVEL>Cybellin</font> asked me if I knew of a trustworthy hunter. Would you like to meet her?<br1>
