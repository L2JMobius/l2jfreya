Examine the list and choose a request you would like to work on. The requests are divided into 3 classes according to their degree of difficulty and amount  of reward. Class C is the most common, of moderate difficulty and reward. Class B is more difficult but with a better reward. We rarely receive Class A requests. They are the most difficult and offer the greatest rewards.<br1>
