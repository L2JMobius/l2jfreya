Did I hurt your feelings? Do you actually intend to try for the hunting license? If so, you must listen carefully to my words... <br1>There are two types of hunters. Most hunters are 1-circle, but very skillful ones can obtain the 2-circle license by passing another test. Of course you must take the <font color=LEVEL>1-circle license test</font> first.<br1>To pass this test, you must bring back at least three of the items on this list.<br1>
