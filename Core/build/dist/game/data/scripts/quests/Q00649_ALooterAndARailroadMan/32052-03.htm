The Bandits around these parts are known as <font color=LEVEL>Rayito's Bandits</font>. They're not very strong but they're tenacious like bugs at a picnic.<br1>
<br1>They survive by hunting the wild beasts around here. They use the beasts' teeth to decorate themselves! Nasty! Bring me <font color=LEVEL>proof that you killed 200 Bandits</font> and I will give you reward.
