You brought the secret book! But...<br1>
Oh, I'm sorry. Actually, while you were away, somebody came with some precious ingredients and I spent my last adena purching them.<br1>
Hmm... What if I do this instead? The method for making wish potion is what's written in the secret book that you brought! I got most of the ingredients with this last purchase but there are still a few things I'm short of. If you'll just bring me those, I'll make wish potion for you that will grant you all of your wishes. How about that? Is that a good deal?<br1>
