<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
I thought I had told you that already! I  foolishly broke the guild's taboo and had dealings with a demon. My desire to create a masterpiece has been my ruin!<br> However, I cannot turn back the hands of time. My honor has been destroyed and all of my apprentices have abandoned me. My pride is long-gone. Now I am reduced to working for the favor of those filthy demons. I have earned my new nickname, "blacksmith of demons".<br>Now all I live for is the drink. Liquor is my only friend.<br>
