So, you didn't find the Divine Sword, but I hear you finally met Jinia. She's a bit severe, but she has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders, so forgive her attitude.<br>Alright, listen. I don't want there to be any doubt about this. What we're going to ask you to do will be dangerous, and it is entirely possible that you may not return... that you may end up just like Kier. If you change your mind about helping us, I'd understand, but we could really use it.<br>Do you still want to help?<br>
