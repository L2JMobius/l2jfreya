<html><body>Disgraced Knight Waldstein:<br1>
Thanks for the help! Master Mordred ordered me to locate the Death Lords, and I decided to infiltrate them to gather more information. This created some nasty rumors about me back in the village...<br1>
Lately, I've been on a pilgrimage with the Death Lords. They're very interested in obtaining the power sealed within the Tablet of Vision. I couldn't bear seeing them obtain the power of the final tablet, and foolishly revealed my true identity by attacking them! I feel like such a fool!<br1>
