Any skilled adventurer in Gracia is permitted to fly. <font color=LEVEL>Hunting</font> and <font color=LEVEL>collecting</font> are possible up there too.<br1>
Of course, you will need to pass a simple test to prove that you're a match for any of the monsters you might encounter. I'm not worried about you, though! So how about it? Would you like to take the test?<br1>
