After defeating the Shadow of Halisha, a friend of mine will come and teleport you to the Pilgrim's Temple. He'll open the Sealed Boxes for you there... Of course, if you don't defeat the shadow of Halisha in time, you'll be sent to the Pilgrim's Temple.<br1>
It's quite a distance from the Pilgrim's Temple to the Imperial graveyard, isn't it?<br1>
