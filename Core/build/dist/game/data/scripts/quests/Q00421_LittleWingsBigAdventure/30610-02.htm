<html><body>Elder Cronos:<br1>
We've had this conversation about hatchlings before, haven't we, my young friend? As I said before, raising a hatchling requires resolve, which you haven't proven to me yet. But would you listen, oh no... So here we are... Have you learned anything?<br1>
Wait, what is this? Why are you carrying all those dragon flutes? A bit greedy, don't you think? You should get rid of all but one of those if you want to own a strider.<br1>
(This quest can only be undertaken by a character with one dragon flute.)
