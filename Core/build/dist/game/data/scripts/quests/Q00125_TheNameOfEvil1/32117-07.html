Mushika suspects that the last of the ancient Elrokian warriors, whose truth has been hidden under the veil of years, the ancient relic he himself once brought out of the Lost Nest, and the cause of his present illness are all related.

Mushika especially wished to discover the identity of the relic and its purpose. Both he and I agree that it is our best -- our only -- clue to these bizarre happenings.<br1>
