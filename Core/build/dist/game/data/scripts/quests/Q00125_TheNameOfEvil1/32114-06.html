I find it difficult to speak of our troubles in detail using your language. Simply put, the Elrokian race is only a shadow of its former self.<br1>
Now an ancient evil has been reawakened, and unless it is stopped we Elrokians will be exterminated entirely. This entire island will revert to the primeval chaos that once ruled here.<br1>
The evil is connected to our old home, the Lost Nest. Do you understand me so far?<br1><br1>
