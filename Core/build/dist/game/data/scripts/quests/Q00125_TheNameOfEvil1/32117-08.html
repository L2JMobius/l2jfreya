Alas, no one knows for certain if it even still exists. But through my sorcery, I can summon the spirits of my ancestors and ask for their guidance.<br1>
The ritual will require special materials that I do not have, however.<br1>
I will especially need <font color=LEVEL>Ornithomimus' claws and Deinonychus' bone fragments</font> to perform the ritual. Can you obtain those materials for me?<br1>
