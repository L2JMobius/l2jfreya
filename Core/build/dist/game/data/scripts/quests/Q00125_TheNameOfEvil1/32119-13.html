<html><body>Ulu Kaimu:<br1>
The dinosaurs are primitive creatures born when the circle of the gods was broken in the ancient time. Possessed of the same power as the giants, they were a threat to the other 5 races -- to the gods themselves, in fact.<br1>
The gods wished to protect the other races from these creatures, but hesitated.<br1>
So the water goddess, Shilen took it upon herself to be a mother to these dangerous creatures.<br1>
She made them a comfortable nest on this Primeval Isle. But she was not blind to the danger of their violent natures. Therefore she designated the brave Elroki tribe to be the guardians of this island and preserve order here.<br1>
