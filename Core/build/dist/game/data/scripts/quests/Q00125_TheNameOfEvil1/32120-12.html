<html><body>Balu Kaimu:<br1>
I am mentally connected with my brother, Ulu Kaimu, whom you also awakened with Shilen's word. I have shared information concerning you with him, so you will not need to prove yourself to him. In fact, the entire flow of history, from the creation of the Lost Nest until the present, made our meeting here and now inevitable.<br1>
It is my mother Shilen's will that I communicate with you. Outsider, tell me: what wisdom do you seek from Balu Kaimu?<br1>
