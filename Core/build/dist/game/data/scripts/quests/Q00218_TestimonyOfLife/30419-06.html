I didn't think you would actually find it...  Even though this is a copy it is certainly <font color=LEVEL>Andariel's Book</font>. I see that your situation is urgent.<br1>
Giving life to that which is destined to die is against nature and contrary to the will of Shilen. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to let die what should die?<br1>
Oh well, it is obvious nothing will change your mind.  I am through talking about it. Here is some <font color=LEVEL>Stardust</font> as promised... Take it and go!
