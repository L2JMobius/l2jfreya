Ten years ago, I was shocked to discover that the Mother Tree was slowly dying.  I worked tirelessly to find the reason...<br1>
Could it be the poisonous wind blowing from the Sea of Spores... Or maybe the disruption of earth energies by forces of nature? Perhaps the Sorcerers of the Dark Elves contaminated the river which feeds the Mother Tree?...<br1>
I looked into every possibility but could not find the reason. Perhaps the Mother Tree is dying from sadness at the injustice in the world...<br1>
We must not lose hope. We must find a way to save our mother Mother Tree... <br1>
