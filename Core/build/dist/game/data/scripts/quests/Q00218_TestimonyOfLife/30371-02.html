We must prepare two things before acquiring the Water of Life. They are the <font color=LEVEL>Grail of Purity</font> and <font color=LEVEL>Talin's Spear</font>.<br1>
Talin's Spear was at one time kept by the Elves living in Innadril Lake, but we decided to move it here.<br1>
You must find the <font color=LEVEL>Grail of Purity</font> that will be the container for the Water of Life. This magic grail will purify anything, and is even said to be able to counteract deadly poisons such as Belladonna. The Water of Life must be contained in this vessel or it will lose potency.<br1>
