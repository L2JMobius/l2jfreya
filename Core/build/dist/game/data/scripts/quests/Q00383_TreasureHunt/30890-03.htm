As a way of escaping my boring daily life, I have a hobby of collecting pirate memorabilia. I'm especially interested in anything to do with Zaken, the legendary scourge of the high seas.<br1>
It is said that he was once Zaken's boatswain, and when Zaken's ship was anchored at Innadril Harbor, he made off with a few Treasure Chests and stashed them somewhere on Alligator Island.<br1>
But, the exact location of the Treasure Chests hasn't been discovered yet...<br1>
