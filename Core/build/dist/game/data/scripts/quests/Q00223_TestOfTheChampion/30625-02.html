<html><body>Mason:<br1>
Ascalon... It has been many years since I heard that name...<br1>
When I left the army I married a beautiful woman named Lillian.  We settled down in my hometown of Dion where we lived a happy and peaceful life and raised our family.<br1>
And then, one dark day, Gracia's army attacked and killed my wife and children. Since then alcohol has been my only friend. I often find myself sitting by the river crying... The grief I feel from my loss is sometimes unbearable...<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>I swear that I shall have my revenge on them.</font> Will you help me?<br1>
