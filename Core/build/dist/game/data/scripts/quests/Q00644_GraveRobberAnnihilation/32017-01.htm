Greetings, and welcome! We are the followers of Pa'agrio, as we are fated to be. Are you free to help us?<br1>
This is the graveyard of a lost tribe, but grave robbers seek to plunder the burial grounds within. And thus, the spirits of the dead have become restless.<br1>
We have decided to drive the grave robbers from this place, but we're short of capable hands and need your help. Can you help us?<br1>
