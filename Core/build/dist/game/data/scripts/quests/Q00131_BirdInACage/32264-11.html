<html><body>Priest Kanis:<br1>
I was able to determine the Shamaness' location by using a relic of Eva that contains the power of the Water Dragon.<br1>
...<br1>
Take this Echo Crystal for now.<br1>
When I confirmed her location through the relic, I was also able to ascertain a little about her condition.<br1>
It seems that her mind has been sealed in order to block her from communicating with the Water Dragon.<br1>
When you find her, you may need this Echo Crystal, which contains the voice of her mother, also a famous priestess.<br1>
