<html><body>Tunath Chief Harak:<br1>
Thank you for coming such a long way, messenger of the Lord of Flame.<br1>
We, the Tunath tribe were sent here 500 years ago to conquer Talking Island when war broke out with the Humans. When the army retreated to the north we were trapped here.   We have always maintained our loyalty to the Lord of Flame. The Elven School of Wizardry on this island was ruined and its legacy turned into ashes. Even to this day, we warriors of the Tunath tribe guard against another possible invasion by the Humans.<br1>
