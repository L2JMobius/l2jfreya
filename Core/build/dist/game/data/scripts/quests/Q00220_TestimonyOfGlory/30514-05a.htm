<html><body>Prefect Vokian:<br1>
Very well! Then I, Prefect Vokian, will give you an order! Defeat these evil creatures and return with proof of your deed.<br1>
There is <font color=LEVEL>Manashen</font>, described as "a stone statue that crosses the sky" near the Ivory Tower of Oren. Smash that thing to pieces and bring back 10 shards.<br1>
There are the <font color=LEVEL>Tyrants</font> who terrorize the Gludio wasteland. Defeat them and bring back at least 10 claws!<br1>
Finally, defeat <font color=LEVEL>Guardian Basilisk</font>, the so-called "guardian of sterility" in Death Pass and bring back at least 10 of its fangs.<br1>
If you are a true heir to the power and pride of the Orcs, you should pass this test easily! Go complete your task and return; I will wait for you here.<br1>
Before you depart, take this <font color=LEVEL>Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
