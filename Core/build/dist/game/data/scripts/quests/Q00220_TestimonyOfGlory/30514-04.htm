To rebuild the kingdom of Orcs we must first crush the dissent within the kingdom! We must <font color=LEVEL>make the renegade Orcs return to the kingdom</font>.  Hundreds of years ago these apostates denied the Lord of Flame's authority and abandoned the kingdom.<br1>
If you will lead the force to subjugate them once again to the great kingdom of Orc, you shall be rewarded with a Mark of Glory by the Monarch. This will ensure your promotion to a higher level!<br1>
But first <font color=LEVEL>you must be tested to see if you are worthy to be the representative of the Monarch!</font> Are you ready for the test?<br1>
