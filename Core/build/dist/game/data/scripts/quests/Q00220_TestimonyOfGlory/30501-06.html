You must take the letter I gave you to the <font color=LEVEL>Chief of the Vuku</font>! On the road north from this village you will find <font color=LEVEL>the army post of Turek Orcs</font>.<br1>
You must never forget that you are the representative of the greatest Flame Lord, Kakai! Always behave with the pride and dignity that your master commands!
