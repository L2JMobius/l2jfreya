<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br1>
When war broke out, the 3 heroes of the Kamael, the Spicula, joined the Giants along with other Kamael.<br1>
They fought well, helping shift the tide of battle in the Giants' favor.<br1>
Mighty Harkilgamed wielded the great sword Enuma Elisha and slew Einhasad's second daughter, while<br1>
Katenar bombarded the goddess' army with the huge gannon, Leopold.<br1>
Meanwhile, Rodenpicula used the impenatrable Shield of Light to ward off all attacks on the Kamael.<br1>
Thatnks to the Kamael, Einhasad and her soldiers were forced to retreat, abandoning her celestial 
palace. The Giants believed that they had won...<br1>
But Einhasad, nearly out of her mind with rage, obtained the Hammer of the Stars, a weapon almost 
unbelievably destructive, and used it to rain huge fireballs upon Grande Peron, the Giants' capital.<br1>
Whole portions of the continent sank into the sea, and within a day the mightiest empire the 
world had ever seen was no more.<br1>
