<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br1>
I myself was born in the Giants' great laboratory, Arviterre, and even assisted in the creation of an 
improved version of the Kamael like yourself...<br1>
However, the gods eventually discovered the Giants' secret.<br1>
Einhasad was enraged, seeing this as an act of rebellion. The other gods, though, were unwilling

hostage by the Giants...<br1>
But Einhasad and her army of angels had no such reservations.<br1>
