According to my investigations, this Resonance Amulet can be repaired with the Divine Stone of Wisdom possessed by both Ketra 
Orcs and the Varka Silenos.<br1>
But I cannot leave here.<br1>
I know you are on a quest to find the Tablets, so this is a task well suited for you.<br1>
Both the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos have a Divine Stone of Wisdom.<br1>
You must earn one tribe's trust obtain their Stone.<br1>
Which tribe will you choose?<br1>
