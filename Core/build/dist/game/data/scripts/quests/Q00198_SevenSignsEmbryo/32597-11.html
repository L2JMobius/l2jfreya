Thank you. We must uncover exactly what has happened and who is behind it all. Shilen stirs, but she can't be acting alone... I must look at our enemies--the Order of Dusk.<br1>
More training is required--much more--before we can even look at them though. I propose a respite: you should leave and prepare yourself for a great fight, while I shall take this Shilen fragment and study it further.<br1>
Priestess Jayna will lead you outside, and I believe Priest Wood has a reward for you.
