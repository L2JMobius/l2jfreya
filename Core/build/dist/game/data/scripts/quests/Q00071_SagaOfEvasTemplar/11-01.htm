<html><body>Priest Cerenas:<br1>
Are you the pilgrim that I've been expecting? I heard about a long-sealed Elven pilgrim being released recently, but I certainly didn't expect to meet him!<br1>
You must be here for the Stone of Commune. If I remember correctly, you should be getting the location of the next stone from the Tablet of Vision, right?<br1>
Sorry, but this one belongs to me and you can't have it!<br1>
