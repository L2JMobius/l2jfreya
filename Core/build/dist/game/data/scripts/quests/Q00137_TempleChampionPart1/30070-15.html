We will now, based on the inspector's report, write a manifesto setting out the Temple's legitimacy and authority. We will then send it to the groups opposed to us.<br1>
In doing so, we will offer them a final chance to repent for forsaking us, and return to our loving fold...<br1>
None of this would be possible without the document you recovered.<br1>
Excellent work! You have already justified my faith in you.<br1>
I know your efforts will not go unrewarded, either in this life or the next.<br1>
