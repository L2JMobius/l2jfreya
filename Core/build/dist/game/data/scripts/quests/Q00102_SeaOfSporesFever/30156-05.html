My friend, you have done well to return. Have you gathered all the Dryad's Tears? Ah, excellent.<br1>
Please wait a moment. All I need to do is add the Dryad's Tears to the mixture that I have prepared.<br1>
Here, I have created the five potions that are needed most immediately. Please deliver this to <font color=LEVEL>Sentinel Knight Alberius</font>.
