Did you also feel the wave of magic emanate from Hellbound a few days ago?<br1>
Hmm, given your power level, it's odd that you didn't feel it...<br1>
I have been conducting my own investigation recently. I discovered that the path to Hellbound has been opened. Fortunately, it is not due to Beleth awakening. I believe it is rather the strength of the Witch that has broken the barrier. If you wish to go to Hellbound, I think you should go find the Witch.<br1>
