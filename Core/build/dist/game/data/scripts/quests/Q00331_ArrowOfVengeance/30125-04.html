You've come back empty-handed. Did you not promise to bring me harpy's <font color=LEVEL>Silver Feathers, the teeth of a Wyrm</font> and the <font color=LEVEL>venom of a medusa</font>?<br1>
As soon as you obtain these three materials, bring them to me. I will reward you for each that you bring back. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so don't worry about the reward. Please don't quit, help me.<br1>
