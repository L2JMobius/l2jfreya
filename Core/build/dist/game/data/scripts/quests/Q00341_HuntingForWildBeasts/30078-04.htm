Excellent! I bet you'll give those filthy bears what they have coming. Kill <font color=LEVEL>the Dion grizzly</font>! Most of the bears by the river have already been killed, so you'll need to search nearby... Try the Dion Hills...<br1>
In Gludio you will also find <font color=LEVEL>red bears, grizzly bears and brown bears</font>. I hate those filthy beasts! If I could I would obliterate every single stinking bear on earth!<br1>
Bring me at least <font color=LEVEL>20 bear pelts</font>. You'll be well-rewarded.
