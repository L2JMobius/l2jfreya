What are you talking about?<br1>
Are you saying <font color=LEVEL>Gentler</font> told you to get the payment for the Spirit Ore from me? I never signed such a Contract! Our agreement was that I would bring the herbs on time and he would pay for them.<br1>
He probably thought he wouldn't see me again because I wander about so much. Go back to <font color=LEVEL>Gentler</font> and get the reward from him!
