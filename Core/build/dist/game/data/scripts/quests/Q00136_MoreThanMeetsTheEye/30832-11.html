The ability to change the soul and then restore it to its original state is an essential condition for transformation magic.<br1>
If the soul perishes after transformation, or if the subject cannot be returned to its original state, the power is worthless.<br1><br1>
Needless to say, this posed an extremely difficult problem even for my intellect, but I was able to use Mimir's Elixir and principles of Necromancy to solve it.<br1>
Still, the process has not been perfected...<br1>
I am now experimenting with a method that I believe may provide that last key.<br1>
By using Mimir's Elixir and the Stabilized Ectoplasm that you brought me, I am reasonably certain that I can allow your soul to endure the transformation process.<br1>
Once in that state of transformation, you should be able to use the Seal of Transformation to further transform at will.<br1>
