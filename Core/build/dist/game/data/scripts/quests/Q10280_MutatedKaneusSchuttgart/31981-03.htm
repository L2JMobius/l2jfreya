Excellent! Visit either of the 2 Kamalokas we can enter from Schuttgart, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.<br1>
You will face the <font color=LEVEL>Venomous Storace and Kel Bilette</font> Kaneus. The Venomous Storace is much weaker, so I'd advise that you pursue it first.<br1>
When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the 2 creatures, take them to <font color=LEVEL>Magister Atraxia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know she and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br1>
Good hunting!
