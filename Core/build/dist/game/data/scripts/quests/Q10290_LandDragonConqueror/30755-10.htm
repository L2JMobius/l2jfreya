And so it is done. Antharas has been stopped and his return prevented.<br1>
I have something for you... something that I rarely am allowed to give. The <font color=LEVEL>Antharas Slayer Circlet</font> is yours.<br1>
What now? I stay, I wait, and I watch. Antharas can never truly be killed. I can only hope that brave warriors such as you come to help and stop Antharas whenever it attempts to return.
