Thanks to your help, we have been able to stabilize the force shield surrounding the Mithril Mine.<br1>
This isn't a permanent solution, but it should buy us some time. I will contact you when we again need your services.<br1>
(This quest can only be completed once per day. It resets every day at 6:30 AM.)
