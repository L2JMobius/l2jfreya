With your help, I was able to defeat my opponent! Here, take this.<br1>
 You'll need this to complete the final stage of the pilgrimage of vision the master told you about..<br1>
I'm content with the fact that I slaughtered the enemy of my master. I'll return now. Take your time, and return when you finish your mission!<br1>
