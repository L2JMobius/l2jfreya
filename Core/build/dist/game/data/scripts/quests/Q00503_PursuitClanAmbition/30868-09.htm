This is really the<font color=LEVEL> Scepter of Judgment</font>... Now we know that this object has truly existed... This is a great accomplishment... Sir Gustaf Athebaldt has sent a letter. He would like all of you to bring the scepter yourselves. However... before you leave... there is something I would like to tell you. My father has told me a lot about you and that's why I'm telling you this. With the kind of capability you have, you can follow your own path. So why are you allowing yourselves to be taken advantage of by someone like Sir Gustaf Athebaldt?<br1>
