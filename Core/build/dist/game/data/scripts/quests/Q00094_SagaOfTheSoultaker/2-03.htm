Ah, the report! Let me see that!<br1>
Oh no! It seems my worst fears about Hindemith are true! He's actually joined Lich King Akron's gang!<br1>
First, I suppose I should tell you about the pilgrimage that Hindemith is believed to have undertaken. It's the quest to become a Soultaker. This test requires the pilgrim to absorb knowledge from six stone Tablets of Vision. This process of absorption is known as communing. Each Tablet of Vision has a corresponding Stone of Commune. These stones are essential to the process.<br1>
It seems the best way to find Hindemith would be to follow the path that he's chosen. I will now give you the<font color=LEVEL> first Stone of Commune</font>. Go to the place where Hindemith was seen last and use it to commune with the Tablet of Vision there. Your new path will then open before you!<br1>
