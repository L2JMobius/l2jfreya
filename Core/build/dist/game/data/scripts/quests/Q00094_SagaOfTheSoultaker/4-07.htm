<html><body>Hindemith Truevoice:<br1>
Huff puff! Thanks for helping me out! I'm Hindemith! Master Hardin sent me to find out what Lich King Akron is up to. I needed to examine his stronghold closely, so I went undercover and joined the gang of the Lich King himself! I'm sure that set tongues wagging back home!<br1>
I recently joined the king on the Pilgrimage of the Stone Tablets. Akron is very interested in the power of the Tablets of Vision. Naturally, I couldn't allow the power of the last Tablet of Vision to fall into his hands! Without thinking of the consequences, I foolishly attacked him and exposed my true identity!<br1>
