Recently, some fearless people have gone into the Tower of Insolence. They are frantically searching for ancient, secret treasure. We of the Gray Pillar Guild cannot be left out of what's going on in there. That tower  was built by dwarves! We can't allow outsiders to plunder it! We already have a team in there.<br1>
Ah, the mysteries of the Tower... How did our noble ancestors do it? It is said that the original blueprints are located somewhere in the tower. Would you be interested in recovering them for us?<br1>
