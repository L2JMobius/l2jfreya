Look here, friend. Have you heard of a jewel called the <font color=LEVEL>Star Diamond</font>? It's an incredibly rare gem -- only 12 in existence. Well, I got a lead on one of them a while back. It was quite a bit of trouble... Heh, heh...<br1>
But the delivery is already four days late...! Ergh...<br1>
Hey, friend! Do you feel like taking on a job? Go find out why my jewel delivery is late. I'll make it well worth your while, so don't worry! I take care of everyone who does work for me. You won't regret it.<br1>
