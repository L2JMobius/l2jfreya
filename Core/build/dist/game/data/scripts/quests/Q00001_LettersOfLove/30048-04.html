You don't know Roxxy?! She is the most beautiful woman on Talking Island... She is also very intelligent -- she was even a student at Oren's Ivory Tower! Now she belongs to the Gatekeeper Guild, able to bend time and space to connect many villages.<br1>
Oh, why would a woman like that ever return the love I feel for her? For months, I vowed every day to tell her how I feel, and every day my courage deserted me. What would I do if she rejected me? Now I've written her a love letter, but I can't bring myself to deliver it.<br1>
May I ask a favor? Would you deliver my letter to Roxxy?<br1>
