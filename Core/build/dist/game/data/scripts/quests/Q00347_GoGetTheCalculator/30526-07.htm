Oh, yes, so I did!<br1>
I believe the reason my previous missions to the moon have not been successful has been due to calculation errors. Any miscalculation in atmospheric resistance, engine burn, or any thousands of other factors inevitably leads to disaster.<br1>
I need to get the <font color=LEVEL>latest model Calculator</font> which has just been introduced in the village. I must get my hands on it! I am certain that this new technology will make my "18th Plan to Conquer the Moon" an unqualified success! Would you please get this Calculator for me?<br1>
