Hello again! Have you brought the <font color=LEVEL>new model Calculator</font>? I guess that was too much to hope for. I see that you are still investigating.<br1>
Remember, there are two trade guilds you should talk to: the <font color=LEVEL>Silver Scale Guild</font> and the <font color=LEVEL>Golden Wheel Guild</font>.<br1>
Please hurry and get the Calculator for me!
