Argh! What's this? This is...! And they call this "new"?<br1>
Ha ha ha!<br1>
I'm sorry, but I have no use for this item. It only does simple arithmetic! I suppose you did your part, however, so I will fulfill my end of our bargain.<br1>
Here is 1500 Ade... Ah! Perhaps you would rather have the calculator? I will be happy to give it to you. You can either take the calculator or accept 1500 Adena.<br1>
