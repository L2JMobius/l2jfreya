Thanks you!<br1>
Then keep hunting <font color=LEVEL>Pterosaurs, Tyrannosauruses and Velociraptors</font> and collect samples of their tissues.<br1>
Just so you know, <font color=LEVEL>1 Dinosaur Egg</font> and 150 Dinosaur Tissues can be processed as a set.<br1>
You can find dinosaur eggs by searching near a dinosaur's lair. But once you touch one, <font color=LEVEL>any dinosaurs nearby will rush back to protect the egg</font>!<br1>
Good luck!
