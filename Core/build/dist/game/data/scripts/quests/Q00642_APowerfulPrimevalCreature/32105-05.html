Good! I know that both the Wizards and Dwarven artisans will welcome your help. This place is far too dangerous for ordinary researchers!<br1>
On to business, then. We need eggs and tissue samples from <font color=LEVEL>Pterosaurs, Tyrannosauruses and Velociraptors</font>.<br1>
Just so you know, <font color=LEVEL>1 Dinosaur Egg</font> and 150 Dinosaur Tissues can be processed as a set.<br1>
You can find dinosaur eggs by searching near a dinosaur's lair. But once you touch one, <font color=LEVEL>any dinosaurs nearby will rush back to protect the egg</font>!<br1>
We will reward you for whatever you bring back. If you'd like to see a list of reward options, just say <font color=LEVEL>"I want to look at other items."</font> Good luck!
