Heavy Armor it is, then! I'll need some D-Grade Crystals, but I know better than to ask a lightweight like you to bring them to me!<br1>
Tell your <font color=LEVEL>Sponsor</font> to bring me <font color=LEVEL>922 D-Grade Crystals</font>. Stop whining! I'm not running a charity here!<br1>
Oh, by the way... <font color=LEVEL>You've got to come back with your Sponsor</font>! How else will I know who to make the Armor for?
