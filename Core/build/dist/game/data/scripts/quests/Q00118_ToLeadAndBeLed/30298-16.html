Go to <font color=LEVEL>the Maille Lizardmen Barracks</font> and defeat the <font color=LEVEL>King of the Araneid</font> and bring me his <font color=LEVEL>8 legs</font>. <font color=LEVEL>You must defeat him while your Sponsor looks on</font>! This of this as an opportunity to prove yourself to him! Naturally, if you get in trouble, he'll be there to help you! This experience should be good for the both of you!<br1>
I'll have your Armor ready when you return with the 8 Legs of the King of the Araneid.
