Oh really? <font color=LEVEL>Nothing in life is free, my friend!</font> This will be no exception! You may as well get ready to pay through the nose for every little piece of material I need! Ha! That look on your face is priceless!<br1>
You won't find this stuff easily, I can promise you that! Nothing I need can be found in a store...<br1>
I'm afraid you'll have to slaughter the <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardmen and their Scouts and Guards</font> in the <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardman Barracks</font> and bring me <font color=LEVEL>10 bottles</font> of their <font color=LEVEL>blood</font>. I can't make the special Armor without it... Now get going! I don't have all day!
