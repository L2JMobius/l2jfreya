Pirate King Zaken once lived here. But it's been said that he may have allied himself with the invaders from the Dream World, which is why adventurers seeking to challenge him now cannot find him.<br>
We believe that he has now created a giant Dream Dimension by drawing on the power of night.<br>
Because of that, Zaken was separated into two individuals, a corporeal one during the day and the other one during the night. He is more powerful now than ever, and he has been attacking the real world from the Dream Dimension.<br>
