Nighttime Zaken was able to rid himself of all weakness. He is basically immortal, except that he can still be attacked through his daytime counterpart...<br>
Since it is a part of Pailaka, the mirror dimension world of dreams, it is possible to mount an attack there. If you go as part of a major force...say, the <font color=LEVEL>union of at least 8 parties</font>, it may be possible to confront him even in this incarnation.<br>
Do you wish to try?<br>
