To change your profession to Human Wizard, you should bring back tokens for each of the four elements of water, fire, wind and earth -- for these form the basis of elemental magic. Visit<font color=LEVEL> Parina</font>, who has long studied elemental magic, to learn how to collect the tokens. She is here in this temple, so you can meet her immediately. You will receive the<font color=LEVEL> bead of four seasons</font> when you collect tokens for all four elements. If you bring me that, you can change profession to become a Human Wizard.<br1>
