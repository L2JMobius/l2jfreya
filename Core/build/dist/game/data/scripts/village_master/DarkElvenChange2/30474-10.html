The Shillien Elder uses Healing Magic mainly, and various Supplementary Magic together. Because they differ from the Human Bishop or Prophet, who incline to one side, they are useful in a small party.<br1>
They have basic skills such as various Healing Magic and Supplementary Magic such as increasing the hit rate and basic abilities.<br1>
To be a Shillien Elder, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Reformer.<br1>
