In order to become a Knight, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Knight test. But, as I mentioned before, you cannot transfer here.<br1>
You must go to <font color=LEVEL>Gludio</font>. <font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Ramos</font> in Gludin Village or <font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Rains</font> in Gludio Castle in the eastern part of Gludin Village will test your qualifications and, if he deems you worthy, transfer your occupation to Knight.<br1>
