To change profession means that you have attained a certain degree of ability and experience, and may be promoted to a higher-level profession. You cannot change profession here, however I can give you some information. If you are a Dwarven Fighter, you can change profession to become an <font color=LEVEL>Artisan</font> or a <font color=LEVEL>Scavenger</font>. Which profession do you want to know about?<br1>
