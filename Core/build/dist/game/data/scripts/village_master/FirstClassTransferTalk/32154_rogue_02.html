<html><body>Grand Master Aldenia:<br1>
In order to become a Rogue, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Rogue test. The Grand Mmaster of the mainland can transfer your occupation -- we do not openly admit that he is a Rogue, but here on this tiny, narrow island we acknowledge him for what he is.<br1>
Journey then to <font color=LEVEL>Gludio</font>. Go to <font color=LEVEL>Gludin Village</font> and seek out <font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Ramos</font>, and he will show how to become a Rogue.<br1>
