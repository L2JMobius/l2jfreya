To meet the qualifications for a Dark Wizard, you must be at least level 20 and have passed the Dark Wizard test. To do so, return to the Dark Elf Village and seek out <font color=LEVEL>Varika</font> near the holy altar located in the southwest part of the village.<br1>
After passing the test, go to the mainland and journey to Gludio, the kingdom of the Humans. The Grand Master of the Dark Elf Guild there will make you a Dark Wizard.<br1>
