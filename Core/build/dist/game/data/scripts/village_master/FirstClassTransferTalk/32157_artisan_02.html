To become qualified as an Artisan, you must first be at least level 20 and have passed the Artisan test.<br1>
Even if you are qualified, however, you must still travel to the mainland to actually change your class. Only a Dwarf who has seen and gained an understanding of the wide world is fit to control the world's economy.<br1>
If you are intent on this path, you should seek out <font color=LEVEL>Blacksmith Silvery at the Dwarven Village</font> in order to take the Artisan test. After passing the test, go to <font color=LEVEL>Gludin Village</font> and speak with <font color=LEVEL>Head Blacksmith Tapoy</font>. If he agrees that you have met the qualifications, he will change your class to Artisan.<br1>
