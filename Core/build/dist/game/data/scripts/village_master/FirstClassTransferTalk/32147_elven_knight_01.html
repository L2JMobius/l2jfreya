<html><body>Grand Master Rivian:<br1>
An <font color=LEVEL>Elven Knight</font> is a warrior whose skill with the sword, both on attack and defense, is virtually unrivalled. The Elven Knights were originally formed to protect the World Tree, the mother of the forest and spirits, but the need for them now is if anything even more pressing.<br1>
The most accomplished Elven Knights may eventually become <font color=LEVEL>Temple Knights</font> or <font color=LEVEL>Swordsingers</font>.<br1>
