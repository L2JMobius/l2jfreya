A <font color=LEVEL>Cleric</font> is a Mystic who is connected to the divine power that surrounds the world. Thus, a Cleric practices mostly white magic and support magic in order to help others, and may perform miracles through the power of the gods. Given their superior healing power, Clerics are generally welcome wherever they go. Clerics who develop their spiritual abilities sufficiently may rise to the level of <font color=LEVEL>Bishop</font> or <font color=LEVEL>Prophet</font>.<br1>
