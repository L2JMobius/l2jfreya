A class transfer occurs when someone with the necessary abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. You cannot complete a class transfer here, unfortunately, but I can give you the information you need. If you are a Dwarven Fighter, you can transfer to a <font color=LEVEL>Scavenger</font> or an <font color=LEVEL>Artisan</font>. Which one would you like to know more about?<br1>
