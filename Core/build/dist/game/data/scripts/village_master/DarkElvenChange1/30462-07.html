<html><body>Grand Master Tronix:<br1>
The<font color=LEVEL> iron heart</font> is only given to those who pass the Test of the Assassin.<font color=LEVEL> Triskel</font> is in charge of that test. He is a great Dark Elf, who has been an Assassin himself for a long time. He is always near the Dark Elven Guild in the<font color=LEVEL> town of Gludio</font>, so you will easily find him once you get there.<br1>
The town of Gludio is northwest of here. Just follow the path. Or use a Gatekeeper if you want to go the easy way. The Dark Elven Guild is in the northeast part of the village.<br1>
