To become a Palus Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You also need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Palus Knight, as well.<br1>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Palus Knight. Go to<font color=LEVEL> Master Virgil</font> of our guild to take the test. You can change profession to Palus Knight only after you take his test and bring back the<font color=LEVEL> gaze of the abyss</font> as proof.
