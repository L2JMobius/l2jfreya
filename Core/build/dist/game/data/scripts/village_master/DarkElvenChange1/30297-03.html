<font color=LEVEL>Palus Knights</font> are the elite knights of the Dark Elves. Their excellent swordsmanship is based on swift, precise attacks and effective defense, and it cannot be compared to other races that depend on mere strength or coarser skills.<br1>
Many of the most talented of Palus Knights are selected for the highest order, as a<font color=LEVEL> Shillien Knight</font>, or become<font color=LEVEL> Bladedancers</font>, with almost unearthly skill in swordsmanship.<br1>
To become a Palus Knight, you must pass the test and bring back the<font color=LEVEL> gaze of the abyss</font> as proof.<br1>
