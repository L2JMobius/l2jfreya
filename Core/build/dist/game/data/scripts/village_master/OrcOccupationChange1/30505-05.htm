Basically, to become a Monk, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br1>
To take the Test of the Monk, seek the Orc named<font color=LEVEL> Gantaki Zu Urutu of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession. Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.<br1>
