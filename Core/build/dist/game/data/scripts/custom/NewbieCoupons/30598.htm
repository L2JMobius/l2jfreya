As token of congratulations, the Adventure Guild is pleased to open its warehouse to both apprentice adventurers who have reached level 6 as well as travelers who have completed their first occupation change. At level 6, you can borrow a <font color=LEVEL>No-Grade Shadow Weapon</font> with the <font color=LEVEL>Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon</font>. At level 20, you can borrow <font color=LEVEL>Shadow Armor</font> with the <font color=LEVEL>Adventurer's Magic Armor Exchange Coupon</font>. No-Grade Shadow Weapons can be exchanged up to level 19 and Shadow Armor can be exchanged up to level 39.
Now then: how can I help you?<br1>
(Note: chaotic characters may not use weapons or armor borrowed from the Adventure Guild.)<br1>
