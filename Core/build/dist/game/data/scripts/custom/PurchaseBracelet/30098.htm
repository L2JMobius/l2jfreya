Ah, you have excellent taste! This bracelet is truly unique. In fact, it is said that it contains an <font color=LEVEL>Agathion</font>. Quite a find, eh? Wondering if it for sale? Of course it is -- that's why I'm here!<br1>
Both this <font color=LEVEL>Little Angel Agathion Bracelet</font> and this <font color=LEVEL>Little Devil Agathion Bracelet</font> were discovered by another group of adventurers while exploring some ancient ruins. I am positive that they contain Agathions! Of course, no one knows for sure the power an Agathion possesses or how long it lasts. I have been reluctant to experiment on them because it's clear that some of the bracelets possess only limited magic power.<br1>
Other have more, however. What you get will depend on your luck, I'm afraid.<br1>
If you wish to buy either the Little Angel bracelet or the Little Devil Bracelet, bring me <font color=LEVEL>25 Big Red Nimble Fish, 50 Great Codrans, 4 Messengers' Skeletons in Crystal of Life, 5 Earth Eggs and 5 Nonliving Nuclei, 3 Dragon Hearts</font>, and <font color=LEVEL>7,500,000 Adena</font>. I wish I could part with them in exchange for crystals as normally would, but the adventurers who delivered the bracelets here insisted on these other items for payment. Even so, I still believe this is a reasonable price. After all, an Agathion isn't something you run across every day, eh? So, would you like to buy one?<br1>
