<html><body>Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:<br1>
Greetings! I am a chamberlain of the ancient Elmoreden empire! When I was a mortal being I worked at the cemetery of the Elmoreden empire. Now I'm here, serving those who are traveling to the cemetery.<br1>
My assistant also assists such travelers. He can be found near the entrance of Argos' Wall.<br1>
Do you plan to visit the Elmoreden Cemetery?<br1>
