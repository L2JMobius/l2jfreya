The Adventure Guild has issued an order requiring us to officially support adventurers who have away from Aden for a long time. These so-called "dormant adventurers," those who have been away for more than 1 year, are now being recruited to return and fight the encroaching darkness.<br1>
If you are one of this group, the Guild would like to offer you a sword and special Welcoming Armor!<br1>
