<html><body>Confidential Report of the Guild:<br1>
 Iconoclasis reacts to physical and magical attacks in the same manner as other evil spirits...<br1>
(Omission)... to summarize, Iconoclasis can be very dangerous. But, if the proper strategy is applied, you have a good chance of defeating him. The best weapon against him is a blunt weapon. Of course, you must defend yourself against the Bead of Holy Flame before you can attack Iconoclasis...<br1>
...I pray for my brothers who read this report. May the divine blessing of Maphr be with you always... (Omission of what follows)<br1>
