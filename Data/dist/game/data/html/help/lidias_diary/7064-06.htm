The twenty-fourth day of Shilen.<br1>
Rose delivered my invitation to Nidrah, and he accepted too easily!<br1>
I was so rushed when I made the preparations!
I must've made a thousand mistakes, but he never complained once!
Was he just being nice?
Or maybe he didn't care!<br1>
He told me that he was here on business; business having nothing to do with our family.
What is he up to?<br1>
