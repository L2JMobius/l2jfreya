<html><body>Reflections on The Army of the White Wings:<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"To all warlords who come after me:"</font><br1>
The Army of the White Wings belong to the Spirits of Light, also known as angels! They take their orders directly from Einhasad, mother of the Spirits of Light! Their appearance is similar to that of angels found in the Tower of Insolence, but they possess some very unique characteristics.<br1>
In my opinion, they ignored their flaws for the sake of a defensive capability and so turned into physical beings.<br1>
To the warlord who will fight against them, I have just one piece of advice:<br1>
