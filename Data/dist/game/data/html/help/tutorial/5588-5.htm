Often after you kill a monster, it will drop the items or adena it possessed. Move the cursor over the item or adena and it will change into a hand-like icon, allowing you to pick it up. Just click to pick it up. The items you have gathered can be viewed in the Inventory Window (Tab or Alt+V).<br1>
