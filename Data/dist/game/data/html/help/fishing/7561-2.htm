<html><body>How to Fish:<br1>
A fishing spot can be wherever there is a large enough concentration of fish to make it worthwhile for people to go fishing.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"If the water is over your head"</font>, you can assume that it has fish in it, but they are also occasionally found in shallow waters, such as the hot springs area in northern Goddard.<br1>
Each spot has its own unique type of fish. The first step to becoming a skillful fisherman is to learn how to find a fishing spot that has the type of fish you like.<br1>
Once you find a good fishing spot, you must be careful not to fish too long there! The fish eventually learn to avoid your bait.<br1>
When the fish stop biting, try another place.<br1>
