The novice lure is a special lure designed by the fisherman's guild to introduce more people than ever before to the challenging but rewarding sport of fishing. The lure is imbued with a special power that <font color="LEVEL">"advises the fisherman (through the Fishing Status window) whether to reel or pump when a fish takes the bait."</font> <br1>
However, this lure responds only to a few special types of fish and not, unfortunately, the types caught in competition. If you want to catch real competition fish, you must use a regular lure.<br1>
