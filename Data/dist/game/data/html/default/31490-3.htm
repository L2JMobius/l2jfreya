There are rules to the<font color="LEVEL">" Rift of Dimension"</font>. Where you go and what goes on inside there remains a mystery. Once you get inside using the fragment, you'll only be able to stay for<font color="LEVEL">" about 40 minutes"</font> before<font color="LEVEL">" the dimension shifts"</font>. Don't forget that.<br1>
If you don't like where you entered, you can<font color="LEVEL">" move just once"</font>.<br1>
This decision must be made by<font color="LEVEL">" the party leader"</font>.<br1>
You may not leave the party or allow anyone else to join your party while there, it's too dangerous.<br1>
