<html><body>Dilos:<br1>
Our enemy currently controls the Seed of Infinity. Keucereus' clan cannot enter unless we first attack. We can assault either the Hall of Suffering or the Hall of Erosion.<br1>
We must destroy the tumors of death and kill the cursed twin knights, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus, in the Hall of Suffering. Be advised that they become stronger the further apart from each other they are.<br1>Destroy the tumors of death in the Hall of Erosion and kill Cohemenes and Argekunte, who share one soul through an infernal contract. They are masters of ancient Gracian magic, but there is a limit to the spells that they can cast at the same time. Keep that in mind when you carry out an assault.<br1>
The road that leads to Ekimus will stay open as long as you defeat his followers in the two halls and his influence weakens...<br1>
