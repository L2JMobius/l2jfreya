At this level, if you prefer to use a speceific attack
skill, train hard to enhance that skill. Upgrade the
ones you already use most when you become
level 10.<br1>
As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first and
only later learn support skills. Therefore, it may
be helpful to learn passive skills like <font color="LEVEL">"Weapon
Mastery, Armor Mastery, Magic Immunity"</font> or <font color="LEVEL">"Soul
Mastery."</font> I also recommend that you learn <font color="LEVEL">"Rapid
Attack,"</font> which temporarily enhances your attack
power.<br1>
