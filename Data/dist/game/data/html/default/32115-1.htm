If you have a trap, then you may use at least 3 types of capture skills. You can only use a capture skill on the predatory Tyrannosaurus.<br1>
If you are capturing a Tyrannosaurus for the first time, you will use the <font color="LEVEL">"Kabokula"</font> technique most among the three capture skills. But you cannot completely capture this powerful predatory dinosaur with just one skill type!<br1>
At this pont, watch the Tyrannosaurus reactions and use the proper skill to maintain its state of captivity. Nothing is a better teacher than your own experience, but since you have come all this way, I will tell you the traditional capture method of the Elkrohki. Listen carefuly.<br1>
