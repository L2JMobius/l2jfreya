You look like a nice, young adventurer. Youth is a good thing. As I grow older, I think more of my younger days... with my dearly departed husband. Nowadays, there's not much I can do to earn a living, that is why I spin yarn out of animal fur and make cloth from that. It's not so bad, I actually really enjoy it.<br>
