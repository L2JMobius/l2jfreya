<html><body>Antique Dealer Patrin:<br1>
It's nice to meet you, young traveler! My name is Patrin. I am a dealer of antiques.<br1>
I've become quite busy lately due to the many excavations going on in the Ruins, the Tower of Insolence and the Garden of Eva. Adventurers are constantly coming to me for appraisals...<br1>
