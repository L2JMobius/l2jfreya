<html><body>Orahochin:<br1>
Welcome! I am Orahochin, proud warrior of the Elroki tribe! I was sent here to guard this place. In truth, I guard the hope and future of the tribe itself. You don't understand? Ah, my young friend, I hope your feet are quicker than your wits! Ha ha!<br1>
See the island over there? There you will find a village of innocent, peaceful Elroki natives. They are far different than the degraded Elrokhians you find here, that I can assure you.<br1>
To protect them, I will transport only those to the island that mean them no harm. Ah... You don't seem like the dangerous sort -- I will teleport you to the island if you wish.<br1>
