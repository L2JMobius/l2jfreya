<html><body>Pathfinder Agent:<br1>
Daytime Zaken is another aspect of Zaken.<br1>
Unlike his nighttime counterpart, he hides himself because he knows he is weak...<br1>
But there is a way to find him. Light a <font color="LEVEL">"candle on a barrel"</font> and it will show you the way.<br1>
But be careful! The candlelight may also alert his subordinates to your location.<br1>
Compared to Nighttime Zaken, Daytime Zaken is not that strong -- you should be able to attack him with a combined force of <font color="LEVEL">"1 to 3 parties"</font>.<br1>
