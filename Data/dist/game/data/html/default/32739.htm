I suppose you're wondering how I manage to stay alive in this habitat. Well, I just smear their dead flesh all over my body, from head to toe. Especially those hard to reach spots. The smell is the worst part. But you get used to it after a while.<br1>
Do you see Torumba over there? He's the chief of the Reptilikon species. They call him "The Omnivore" because he once ate one of his own messengers just for reporting news he didn't like.<br1>
If you're thinking about taking on Torumba, your best bet is to change yourself into one of his own kind. I believe a Treykan would work best. I can perform the ritual - however, it requires a great amount of energy.<br1>
