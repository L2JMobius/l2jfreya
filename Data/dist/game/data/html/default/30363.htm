<html><body>Blacksmith Aios:<br1>
May the splendor of mithril forever shine on the forest and lake! I am a blacksmith and I look over the weapons and armor of my Elven brothers. I have just returned from the Dwarven Kingdom in the north where I learned how to process adamantium and oriharukon.<br1>
I have finished setting up my shop and am ready to start work. Now, what do you need?<br1>
