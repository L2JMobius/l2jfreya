<html><body>Ghost of Adventurer:<br1>
What brings you here? I'm an archaeologist... Heh heh... One of these days I'll stop lying! 
Technically, I'm a grave robber impersonating an archaeologist! 
Every time I've tried to steal a valuable item I've failed miserably!<br1>
While sitting around feeling like a failure, I heard a rumor that several graves from the Elmoreden 
empire existed somewhere in this cemetery. Basically, I'm here looking for easy stuff to steal! 
But I was attacked and killed by evil creatures and turned me into the ghost you see before you now! 
I didn't know there were so many evil creatures here! Dammit all!<br1>
