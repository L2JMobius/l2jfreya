It is fortunate for us that Freya is absent for we could never dare to threaten her favored pets otherwise.  We will lure them forth with the Silver Hemocytes you gave me.<br1>
If you enter the garden before the gate closes, I will be unable to help you at all. Therefore, please make your move after the gate has closed. Until then, you may wait here and make your preparations as you think best.  Never forget:  Your goal is to get rid of  the Ice Fairy Sirra, a pest who is unjustly favored by the Queen.<br1>
