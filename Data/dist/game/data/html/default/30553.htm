I must kill them! I must kill them all! Huge mouth! Gigantic eyes! The rough sound of breathing! I still remember everything... Right in front of me, it opened its mouth and swallowed my parents and grandma... Finally, it was about to lunge out to eat me! Then a Master Raider appeared all of a sudden and saved my life... <br1>
If it wasn't for that stupid Master Raider, I wouldn't have had to live like this... Everyone was killed! Only I survived! I should have been killed with my parents and grandma... Do you know how hard it is for a woman to live alone?! I will kill the wolves! I will kill them all!!! <font color="LEVEL">"I will kill the wolves who took my happiness away!!!"</font><br1>
