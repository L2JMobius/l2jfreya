<html><body>Atuba Chief Varkees:<br1>
Tejakar Oroka! The Orcs have thousands of tribes! However, only seven tribes carry on the noble blood! I am going to sing their names, so listen well!<br1>
The brave Hestui!<br1>
The cold-hearted Atuba!<br1>
The persistent Neruga!<br1>
The strong-willed Urutu, the resourceful Duda-Mara!<br1>
And the merciless Gandi!<br1>
One more thing! There are tribes of traitors that betrayed their own kind! Their names are forgotten!<br1>
