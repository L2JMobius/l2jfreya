Kassandra was born with the soul of dreaming flames... It's that ability that's passed down to the prophets of the Duda-mara Orcs. I can't imagine why such a blessing was given to a child of Dwarves, but it is surely the will of Paagrio. Until her fate becomes known, I'll protect Kassandra with my life!<br1>
