You want to know about the purification device?<br1>
Well, it's no exaggeration to say that it's vital to the survival of this base. It not only purifies polluted air and water, but also supplies energy to the Barrier Orb. Naturally, it's a primary target for enemy attacks.<br1>
But as long as I have anything to say about it, they won't break through without a serious fight! <br1>
