<html><body>Oracle Guide:<br1>
A mysterious five-colored whirlwind swirls within an aquamarine sphere, and you hear a clear, cultured voice.<br1>
Welcome. I am the first child of the Oracle. My mistress ia <font color="LEVEL">"Parme"</font>, the Shamaness of the Water Dragon. She is currently under the enemy's control, but an Oracle led me to this place just before she was captured.<br1>
My mission is to safely escort you to her current location.<br1>
Unfortunately, that place is unreachable without proper preparation.<br1>
If you are ready, please give me your hand, and I shall open the way.<br1>
