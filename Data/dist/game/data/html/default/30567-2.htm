<html><body>Neruga Chief Tantus:<br1>
Elmore is the Kingdom of the Humans that controls the northern part of the continent -- land that used to be under our control! This inferior race, who used to be our humble slaves, now dominates the continent. How ridiculous! But they will not last long! The legions of the Orcs will march from the Immortal Plateau and subjugate all races of all nations!<br1>
