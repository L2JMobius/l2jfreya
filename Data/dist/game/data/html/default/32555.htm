Huh! What, are you laughing at me? I can barely stand, and you think it's funny? <br1>
But this isn't the end. I'm just conserving my strength so I'll be ready to fight...<br1>
Trust me, when the time comes I'll fight for my lord and for the future of Gracia. I don't care if the enemy is the power of darkness, that fool Karneia or greedy adventurers from far-off lands!<br1>
