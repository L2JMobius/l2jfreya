<html><body>Priest Kanis:<br1>
I am Priest Kanis, and I serve the great Shamaness Parme of the Crystal Oracle, who offered herself as a sacrifice in order to appease the Water Dragon Fafurion.<br1>
Several days ago, Demons, crazed sevants of the Water Dragon and Crystal Golems attacked the Oracle it was completely destroyed, and the people of the Oracle were killed or captured.<br1>
Only I was able to escape to seek help...<br1>
