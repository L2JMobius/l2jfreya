<html><body>Neruga Chief Tantus:<br1>
Tejakar Paagrio! Praise the name of the Flame! This Immortal Plateau has been our sacred ground from ancient times, but while I, Tantus, was living among the humans of the <font color="LEVEL">"Kingdom of Elmore"</font>, foreign invaders and Orc traitors brought disgrace to this land!<br1>
Now I am back, and I will not forgive those who disgraced our sacred place!<br1>
