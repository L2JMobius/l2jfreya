<html><body>Tataru Zu Hestui:<br1>
Tejakar Oroka! Nice to meet you, young traveler. I am the Tataru of the Hestui Tribe! I am one of the Shamans who passes on the teachings of flame from the god Paagrio!<br1>
The spells of the Orcs are to control the spirits through the authority of fire! We are entirely of a different level than the Elves who worship spirits like they were divinities and Humans, who misunderstand magic as science!<br1>
