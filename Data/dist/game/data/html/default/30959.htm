<html><body>Musician Barbado:<br1>
Welcome, you fresh-faced traveller! I am a musician, an artisan of melodies. Music is the finest blessing bestowed upon us by Eva, the goddess of art. When your feeling blue, as I sometimes do, nothing cheers you up like a cheerful tune played on the accordian! It will lighten the darkest mood!<br1>
