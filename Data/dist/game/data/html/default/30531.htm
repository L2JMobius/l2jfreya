<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br1>
Welcome, young friend, to the House of Elders. My name is Lockirin Stonecutter. I am the eldest Master of the <font color="LEVEL">"Iron Gate Guild"</font> and also the First Elder of the <font color="LEVEL">"Association of Guild Elders"</font>. These titles sound fine enough, but really my job is to keep these headstrong old chaps in line.<br1>
