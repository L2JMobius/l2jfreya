<html><body>Asamah:<br1>
I am Asamah, son of Mushika, chief of the Elroki tribe. These are our lands. In them lies perhaps our last hope to return to our ancient ancestral home. But these days are evil, and our hope is waning before this threat.<br1>
Our strength has run out like water from a broken pot, and although my ancestors would be shamed to ask foraid, I believe only an outsider like yourself can save us now.<br1>
