<html><body>I am pleased to tell you what I know, but I do not know everything. You should speak to as many of the villagers as you can.<br1>
Have you already spoken to<font color="LEVEL">" Abyssal Celebrant Undrias"</font> at teh gate of the Temple of Shilen? He may want to ask a favor of you.<br1>
Also, seek out<font color="LEVEL">" Sentry Nelsya"</font> at the north entrance of the village. 'Tis the season of Shilen's Hunting Ceremony, and they are looking for volunteers.<br1>
Let's see... ah, yes! See that you speak to<font color="LEVEL">" Collette"</font> and to Trader Payne as well.<br1>
