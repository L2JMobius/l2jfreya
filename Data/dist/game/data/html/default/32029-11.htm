The Ice Fairy Sirra was once Freya's maid before Freya became the Ice Queen.  For reasons we do not know, she was transformed into a solid block of ice. Freya made a bargain through prayer for Sirra's life, but could not accept her new incarnation and left Freya's service.<br1>
Even though her anger and torment overwhelmed her, Sirra remained close to her former master and thus, came to stay in Freya's garden. We have recently learned that the Ice Queen also granted Sirra the power to draw from the life force of any creature within the garden. Thus, if you kill the creatures of the garden first, it will be easier for you to kill the Ice Fairy.<br1>
