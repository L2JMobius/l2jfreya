This entire area acts almost like a living organism. <br1>
Just as blood supplies nutrients to a human body, so apparently do the souls who have perished here supply energy for the <font color="LEVEL">"Tumors of Death and the Soul Coffins"</font>.<br1>
They in turn use that energy to strengthen nearby monsters or disadvantage attacking adventurers. Destroy those things whenever you encounter them. Of course, that's easier said than done -- the nearby monsters will defend it fiercely.<br1>
But if you're able to destroy a Tumor, you will gain an advantage over the monsters. We don't know for sure, but we think that the newly-freed souls help us. It is possible to communicate with a <font color="LEVEL">"Destroyed Tumor"</font>, and you can also use it to teleport to other Tumors, although you'll need something called <font color="LEVEL">"Tears of a Freed Soul"</font> to do so.<br1>
