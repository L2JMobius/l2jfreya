Welcome, youngster. Our shop offers both magic items and more mundane supplies. We cater to not only magicians, but also to warriors seeking protection against magic -- and even ladies looking for pretty accessories... So many people come to our shop! We even have adventurers seeking clues to the location of the <font color="LEVEL">"Sword of Othelotte"</font> in some of our ancient spellbooks... They must think this is a blasted library!<br1>
