Hello! Isn't it a beautiful day?<br1>
Would you like to have a symbol made?<br1>
Have you brought dye?<br1>
Symbols are not easily made!<br1>
You must be certain of what you want before we begin! This is an expensive project and you cannot afford any false starts!<br1>
Although expensive, if you choose well, your symbol will be a good investment for you, as valuable as an excellent sword or shield!<br1>
