Welcome to Hunters Village! Normally ruffians gather here, but recently I've been seeing more and more normal people like you around. I will ask you a favor though... please don't stir up any commotions.<br1>
To the south of the Hunters Village is <font color="LEVEL">"Dragon Valley,"</font> and over by Castle Giran, <font color="LEVEL">"Giran Castle Town"</font> is situated.<br1>
