Have you seen the road that leads to Aden Castle? Actually, that road was paved some time ago, during the time of Elmo-Aden kingdom. At that time, through that road a lot of commodities must have traveled between north and south. During the war, many parts of the road has been damaged and the repair work is still in progress.<br1>
