It was the uprising against the von Hellmann family. In that forest the last of the rebel forces were captured by the king's men. They were cruelly tortured and publicly executed. The forest was never the same after that. A cursed fog continually hangs over the place.<br1>
Its said that dead walk the earth there, and vampire ghosts feast on trespassers! Dark forces are surely at work in that place!<br1>
It's said that some people have actually taken up residence in an abandoned village in the middle of the forest! What are they thinking? I'm not sure if they're very foolish or very brave!<br1>
