The village is divided into two levels. The lower level consists of residential housing, stores and various race guilds. The upper level features upscale housing, a temple and various clan halls.<br1>
The elite classes here aren't as liberal as what you'll find elsewhere in Aden. Here, they take themselves quite seriously. They're quite particular about who they allow on the upper level. But an adventurer like yourself shouldn't have any problems!<br1>
