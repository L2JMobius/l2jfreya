Gludin is a large port village on the southwest coast. Ships to Talking Island depart from there regularly.<br1>
If you want to go to the village of Gludin, take this road west until you come to a fork in the road, then take the road that goes southwest. You have to pass the Abandoned Camp, where ol mahum deserters are encamped, so be particularly careful.<br1>
