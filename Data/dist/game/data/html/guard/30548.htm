<html><body>Defender Nathan:<br1>
I see  that the Spine Mountains are already covered with snow... It makes me realize how we Dwarves are just a small part of a much larger universe!<br1>
Go ahead, take a good look at the mountains... Don't wealth and fame seem insignificant now?<br1>
Oh, I should introduce myself! I'm  Nathan, a Defender of  this village. I must stand guard no matter how cold the winter gets!
