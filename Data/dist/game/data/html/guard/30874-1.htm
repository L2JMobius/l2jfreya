A king of the Elmoreden Empire named Baium was said to be someone that wanted to reach the world of the gods and to ultimately become a god himself. When he became king and went crazy, he didn't just do so in a good way but caused great suffering to the people... Anyway, he started to build that tower in order to go to the world of the gods. But the gods destroyed that tower and confined the king in the tower forever. But... No, no... it's nothing. Anyway, so that tower came to be called the Tower of Insolence due to the arrogance of the king.<br1>
