<html><body>Guard Leon:<br1>
Welcome to the Talking Island Village! I am Leon, one of the guards here. Our duty is to protect the village from the invasion of Orcs or werewolves and punish those who violate the laws of this kingdom.<br1>
Those who harm others are dealt with severely according to the orders of the king. You may think it is merciless, but I think that those who injure others deserve the same.<br1>
