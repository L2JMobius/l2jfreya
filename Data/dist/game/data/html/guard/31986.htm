Brrr! It's freezing out here! Nothing like a mug of Kofporch to thicken the blood on a day like this. What? You've never heard of Kofporch? Where've you been, kiddo? Were you born yesterday?<br1>
Kofporch is only brewed in a few areas in Schuttgart Territory. The best kinds are then hauled out and left to age in either the<font color="LEVEL">" Den of Evil"</font> or the<font color="LEVEL">" Crypts of Disgrace"</font>. Dangerous? Sure! But believe you me, no imitation even comes close!<br1>
