The<font color="LEVEL">" Monastery of Silence"</font> was established by the<font color="LEVEL">" Order of Saint Solina"</font>, a branch of the Einhasad Temple.<br1>
Other travelers have said that it has a very austere and quiet atmosphere. The monks rarely speak with outsiders. Since it's in the middle of nowhere, it's a wonderful place for quiet meditation.<br1>
