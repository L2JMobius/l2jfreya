If you follow this road northeast, you will come to the Ruins of Agony. Originally, it was the village of Bernice, where I was born, but it was reduced to ashes by the war. If you see its ghastly state, you will understand why it's now called the <font color="LEVEL">"Ruins of Agony."</font><br1>
If you pass the ruins and continue north, you will arrive at the <font color="LEVEL">"forest where the Dark Elves live"</font>. Although I've never gone there myself... Travelers say that it is dark and eerie in a very unnatural way. <br1>
