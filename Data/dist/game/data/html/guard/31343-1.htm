The<font color="LEVEL">" Valley of Saints"</font> has been a holy place since ancient times. The saints of Einhasad Temple are buried there. It's also the only way to the<font color="LEVEL">" Monastery of Silence"</font>.<br1>
According to rumors, kel mahums have started showing up recently in the Valley of Saints blocking the path to the monastery. Terrible things must be going on there! Unless you have an important business there, you'd best stay away from that area.<br1>
