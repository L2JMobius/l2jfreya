I suppose our village looks peculiar to outsiders. It's divided into three sections.<br1>
The castle has an upper and lower level. The upper level consists of a<font color="LEVEL">" clan hall and the Temple of Einhasad"</font>. The lower level features the<font color="LEVEL">" Library of Sages"</font> and a<font color="LEVEL">" Combat Training Camp"</font>.<br1>
Just in front of us is our latest development! It's our commercial district, with<font color="LEVEL">" Dwarven stores, blacksmith shops and warehouses"</font>.<br1>
