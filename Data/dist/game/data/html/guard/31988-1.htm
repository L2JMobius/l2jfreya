I knew you were up to it! You'll make a wonderful assistant! Now, listen! My research says that you'll find the tombs of Dwarven mine workers who were killed in an explosion while digging a tunnel through Iron Curtain Mountain. There's a huge amount of rare minerals hidden under their gravestones! Are you interested?<br1>
