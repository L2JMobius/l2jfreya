Have you been to Lake Narcel to the south of the village? In the past, you could rent a boat at the pier and go for a ride or fish from the side of the river... It was very nice. But because of the war, all the recreational facilities on the lake were closed. Um, there are those who say that recently they saw His Royal Highness Amadeo riding in a boat there with Sir Castella... Could this be a sign that we will soon be able to enjoy fishing and boat riding in the lake like before? If so, that would be great...<br1>
