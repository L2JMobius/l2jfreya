Depending on its type, you may be able to evolve your pet. Evolution is only possible when the pet is summoned. Also, since the process transfers the experience value, evolving a high level pet might actually result in a decrease in the pet's level.<br1>
Any items in the pet's inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory.<br1>
