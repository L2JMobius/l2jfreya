Welcome! My fellow Magisters and I were dispatched to the Ivory Tower of Oren in order to instruct Giran's finest youths in the ways of magic.<br1>
It looks like you're from a small country school. Did you study at Einhovant's School of Magic? Hmmph! I wonder if you were even taught the basics correctly! I'm a little worried that you won't be able to keep up with my lessons, but...<br1>
Well, let's just get started and see how you do. If you don't understand something, don't feel embarrassed to ask.<br1>
