Welcome to Hunters Village! Besides the hunters who come here in search of exotic monsters, you'll also find a whole crowd of adventure-minded types in this town: bounty hunters, information brokers, relic expeditionary teams... A wink is as good as a nod, eh? This village couldn't be better for business.<br1>
