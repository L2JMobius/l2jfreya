Have you been to the Enchanted Valley? They say that there are still Fairies secretly living there. In the ancient Elmoreden Empire, Fairies were hunted as exotic trinkets. Finally they fled into the deepest recesses of the forest there...<br1>
If those legends are true, how fearful they must have been! I hope they at least find joy in the songs of the stars...<br1>
Now, what can I do for you?<br1>
