May your spirit be as peaceful as the waters of a calm lake. It is always nice to meet a fellow Elf in this strange land.<br1>
To see the people here, you would never think they had known anything else but peace and prosperity. But in fact there is a hidden <font color="LEVEL">"Dark Shadow"</font> here.<br1>
Perhaps you will one day discover the identity of that Darkness. As a student of magic, just remember that one cannot judge something based solely on its appearance...<br1>
