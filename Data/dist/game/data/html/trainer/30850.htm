There's something afoot in the Cemetery. Some Dwarven bandits named the Magpie Brothers are tunneling into tombs and robbing the dead...and they're not alone. I doubt even Maphr would condone such behavior...<br1>
A few days ago I gave a lecture on how to capture Dwarves alive. Would you like to hear some tips?<br1>
