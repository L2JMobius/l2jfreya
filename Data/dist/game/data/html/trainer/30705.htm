Hey you!<br1>
I am in charge of the guild here in Hunters Village. Open your ears and listen to what I say.<br1>
There are 3 things you must remember here in Hunters Village: 1), whether people or prey, judge no one based on their appearance; 2) go to the hunting grounds only with trusted comrades; and 3) always obey my commands without hesitation. That is the most important precept!<br1>
