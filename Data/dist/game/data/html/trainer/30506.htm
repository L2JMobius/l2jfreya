O follower of the Flame!<br1>
Be welcome here! I have been dispatched here to the Town of Gludio, but I have not forgotten our pride, honor and glory. The same cannot be said of the wretched Turek, Enku and Vuku tribes. They deserved to be cursed forever! Do not follow their example. Be true to your heritage!<br1>
