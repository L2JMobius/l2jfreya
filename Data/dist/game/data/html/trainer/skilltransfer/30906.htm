What do you know about Devil's Isle? I heard a rumor that the ghost of Great Pirate Zaken still haunts it... Our temple is definitely not happy with that... This is all due to those greedy adventurers seeking treasure there -- they must have awakened Zaken's spirit. Well, they paid the price for their avarice; not a one of them returned. If you choose to set foot on that accursed island, take great care. Only the light of Einhasad can vanquish so powerful an undead...<br1>
