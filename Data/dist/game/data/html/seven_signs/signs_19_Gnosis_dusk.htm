<font color="LEVEL">"[Seal of Gnosis]"</font><br1>
When we control the Seal of Gnosis, we gain the following benefits:<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Catacomb Possession:"</font><br1>
The Army of Dusk will possess 6 catacombs, and non-members will be denied access to the catacombs. In the case of a draw, both groups will be able to enter.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Exclusive Trade with the Blacksmith of Mammon:"</font><br1>
We will be able to trade the Blacksmith of Mammon, who appears in the catacombs. When we give Ancient Adena to the Blacksmith of Mammon, we will receive special services such as trading for C, D or some B grade equipment, or obtaining A grade weapons with special abilities.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Benefits of Teleport:"</font><br1>
By using Ancient Adena through the priest, we can teleport more cheaply than in the Necropolis or the catacombs.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Orator of Revelations:"</font><br1>
An Orator of Revelations will appear in each village to grant our allies the blessing of darkness.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">"Preacher of Doom:"</font><br1>
A Preacher of Doom will appear and curse our enemies, the Lords of Dawn.<br1>
