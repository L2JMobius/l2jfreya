A necropolis is an ancient temple hidden deep underground. The recent discovery of an Ancient Scroll has disclosed its location. If you slay Nephilim, Gigant, Lilim and Lith there, you can obtain seal stones.<br1>
The necropolises are linked to the seal of Avarice. During the competition, you can go in and out of the place freely.
