Do you wish to participate in the Seven Signs as a member of the Revolutionaries of Dusk?<br1>
Remember, if you do, you'll belong to the Revolutionaries of Dusk during the next seal validation period. If we win, you'll enjoy the spoils of victory. But if we lose, you must hold your head high through a humiliating loss.<br1>
Do you properly understand your obligations and rights as a participant? OK, then. I'll ask you again. Do you really want to participate in Seven Signs?<br1>
