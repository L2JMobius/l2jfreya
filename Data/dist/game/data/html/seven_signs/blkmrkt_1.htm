<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br1>
Out of respect for the traditions of the old empire, both the Lords of Dawn and the Revolutionaries of Dusk use <font color="LEVEL">"Ancient Adena"</font> as their currency.<br1>
Certainly, traditions and customs are important, but in this day and age... If you go to the market with those ancient coins, you won't be able to buy anything! Right?<br1>
Say, do you have any Ancient Adena weighing down your purse? I can help you.<br1>
Also, if your weapon carries a special capability you no longer want, I can remove it. No questions asked!<br1>
I also carry rare goods that you won't find anywhere else. Stop by and see for yourself some time. You might just find a once-in-a-lifetime deal...<br1>
