A manor refers to any property owned by the lord. Anything produced within its confines remains the exclusive property of the lord.<br1>
You are to be an agricultural producer. First you must buy a &nbsp;<button action= "bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link manormanager/manor_client_help002.htm" value="seed" width="270" height="25" back="L2UI_ct1.button_df" fore="L2UI_ct1.button_df">&nbsp; and place it onto a monster. This is easily accomplished while targeting.<br1>
When the monster dies you will harvest a crop from its body. To harvest a crop you will target the corpse onto which a seed was sown and use the harvester. If you need one, I'll be happy to sell you a harvester. These crops are the major product of the manor. After you have harvested, bring the &nbsp;<button action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link manormanager/manor_client_help003.htm" value="crop" width="270" height="25" back="L2UI_ct1.button_df" fore="L2UI_ct1.button_df">&nbsp; to me. The crop is the specialty of our territory. For harvesting, target the monster.<br1>
I will appraise it and give you an appropriate reward for it! If you want to know what the reward will be, I will tell you about it later...<br1>
