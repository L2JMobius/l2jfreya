<html><body>High Priest Prana:<br1>
May the great glory of light surround you always... Life has brought me to this countryside setting in order to teach people. Even so, piety can be found anywhere. But where religious feeling is strong, the work is all the more rewarding. Since I am here representing the Humans, I cannot complain in any event -- leaving such a sensitive task in the hands of an inexperience slip of a girl would make me far too anxious.<br1>
