<html><body>Warehouse Chief Hoffa:<br1>
I'm Hoffa, the Warehouse Chief in charge of this place. Actually, the real Warehouse Chief is working at the embassy, but he's much too busy...<br1>
So I have the contract for this Kamael Village warehouse now. You can trust me, I promise! So what brings you here?<br1>
