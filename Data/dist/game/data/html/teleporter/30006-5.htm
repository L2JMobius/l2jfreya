The Airship Field is where Airships heading to and from <font color="LEVEL">"Gracia"</font> dock. A powerful magic force field prevents entry to Gracia from sea or via teleportation.<br1>
But Gracian-made Airships can travel safely through the force field. It is still a dangerous journey, though!<br1>After several years of work, a wharf was constructed from magical stones capable of floating in mid-air. You can board one of the Airships using an <font color="LEVEL">"Airship Controller"</font>.<br1>
If you wish to visit Gracia, this is the only way. I can teleport you to the wharf if you wish.<br1>
