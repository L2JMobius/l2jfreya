Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">"level 81 or higher"</font>, it's been  reported that Earthworm Eggs were recently discovered in the Mithril Mines when some grave robbers broke the Seal of Lucien.<br1>
As a result, the eggs of Trasken hatched. Because of a recent earthquake, entry to the Mines has been severely restricted. <br1>
Fortunately, although the new monsters are powerful, they are still relatively few in number. A group of skilled adventurers is being sought to deal with the situation.<br1>
If you are interested, I can send you to one of the entrances to the Mines. The monsters are equally strong in either location.<br1>
