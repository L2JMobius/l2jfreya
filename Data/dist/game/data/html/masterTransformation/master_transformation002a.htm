<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br1>
To learn the magic of transformation, you will need to receive special training.<br1>
Find the Wizard of Darkness, who lives at Hardin's Academy. He will open the path to transformation.<br1>
You must have reached at least <font color="LEVEL">"level 50 "</font> to embark on this path.<br1>
You will also need a special seal. I do not know how you can obtain it, but without it transformation is impossible.<br1>
