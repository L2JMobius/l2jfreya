Most of the Leto Lizardmen died from the poisons of the plants found on the plains, but those who didn't seem to have evolved into a new race called the Tanta Lizardmen. However, I believe there are some Leto that are still living in an area outside the Plains of the Lizardmen, avoiding the poisons and maintaining their original appearance.<br1>
I think they live in the shadow of a hill <font color=LEVEL>northeast of the Plains, near the road leading to the Hunter's Village.</font><br1>
In fact, I'm sure of it! I saw them myself.<br1>
