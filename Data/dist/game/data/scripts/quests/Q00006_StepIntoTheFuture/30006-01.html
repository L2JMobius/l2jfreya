I'm very fortunate to have a job that allows me to travel across the continent.<br1>
How many others can say they've seen the grandeur of Aden Castle or visited Giran's bustling markets or watched the sun set over the waters of Heine?<br1>
Despite my love of travel, though, I was happy to return home here to Talking Island...at least for now.<br1>
(Only Humans who are level 3 or above may undertake this quest.)
