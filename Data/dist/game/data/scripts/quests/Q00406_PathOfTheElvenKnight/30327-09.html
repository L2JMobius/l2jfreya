Congratulations. You safely completed the test. The topaz you brought back will be used as an ingredient for the "Elven Knight Brooch.&quot, which will be proof of your skill, enough that you can then present yourself to a grand master.<br1>
But the "Elven Knight Brooch" cannot be completed with just the topaz fragment. Take this letter and go see <font color=LEVEL>Blacksmith Kluto in Gludin Castle Town.</font> He will tell you how to make the "Elven Knight Brooch" with these jewels. If you don't know the way to Gludin Castle Town, go ask Guard Praga.<br1>
