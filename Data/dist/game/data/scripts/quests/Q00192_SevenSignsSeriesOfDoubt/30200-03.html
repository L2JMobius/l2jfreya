I was out walking through the<font color=LEVEL>Oren Castle</font> grounds a couple of nights ago. Truth be told, I was clearing my head - women problems, see?<br1>
Anyway, there I was, when it a chill creeps up my spine and everything goes deathly quiet. Suddenly this thing appears in front of me, makes some weird old sound, and... I could feel its eyes looking... looking INTO me.<br1>
Then, quick as a click, it was gone.<br1>See... told you. It was nothing.<br1>
