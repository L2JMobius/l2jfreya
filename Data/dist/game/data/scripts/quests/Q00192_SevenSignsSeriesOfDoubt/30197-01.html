Here about the murderer aren't you?<br1>
Can't blame you--I'm sure there's quite some bounty on his head, but I ain't here to aid the fear mongering that's been going on, no sir.<br1>
Besides, stay within Oren's walls and you'll be safe as houses. What's outside that pulls so many out, anyway? I swear... the folk in these parts have their heads in the clouds. They're all crusade this, save the world that....<br1>
Now, look at me. I'm happy, I'm content. Keep people safe, and sleep sound as a bear in Winter.<br1>
