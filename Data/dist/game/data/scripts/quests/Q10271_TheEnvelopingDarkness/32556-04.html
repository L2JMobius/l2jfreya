We were sent to <font color=LEVEL>protect the group dispatched to investigate the Seed of Destruction</font>. We were part of a large force and felt invincible. At first everything went well.<br1>
Then...we were attacked by the Mounted Troop. We kept fighting in order to complete our mission. While some of us kept up a rearguard defense, a few others tried to deliver the documents containing records of our investigation to the fortress. <font color=LEVEL>Inspector Medibal</font> and I were ordered to deliver them. Thanks to our soldiers' efforts we were able to get out...barely. But as we were almost clear, Medibal and I were both hit. And...and I couldn't grab the <font color=LEVEL>inspection documents</font> he was holding. I betrayed the trust of my comrades. I failed them...<br1>
