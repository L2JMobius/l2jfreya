What's holding you back? If you're not up for this mission, you'd better let me know now...<br1>
Otherwise, go hunt <font color=LEVEL>Ragna Orcs</font> and the <font color=LEVEL>Evil Spirit of Baranka, the Destroyer of Baranka</font>. Since they are possessed by evil spirits emanating from the <font color=LEVEL>Ragna Orc Amulets</font> they wear, you must retrieve those accursed pendants. The more you bring me, the higher your reward.<br1>
Some Ragna Orcs carry the <font color=LEVEL>Soul Core Containing Evil Spirit</font> instead of an amulet. If you collect 10 of those, you may challenge the Leader of the Ragna Orcs to a duel. Do not do so lightly!<br1>
