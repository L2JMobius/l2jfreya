I don't know where they came from. But they occupied Devil's Isle and kicked out all the Humans and Dwarves. We can't just do nothing...<br1>
We must fight them! Here, take this sword. It can summon the <font color=LEVEL>Tigress</font>, our fleet's guardian spirit. She will certainly be able to help you!<br1>
