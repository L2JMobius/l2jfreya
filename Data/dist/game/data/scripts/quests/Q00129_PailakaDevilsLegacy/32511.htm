That cursed pirate has finally fallen! Now I must ask you to return the sword. It is also a legacy of this place, so if you take it away -- even by mistake -- you will incur the curse of Devil's Isle.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>If your Tigress is beside you, return her to the sword before giving it to me.</font><br1>
