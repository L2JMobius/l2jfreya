I'm not the only one who has these nightmares! And all of us are both emotionally -- and, strangely enough, even physically -- drained upon waking.<br1>
I thought it was this Kamaloka I've heard about, but they say it's something else. It couldn't be entered in the same way as Kamaloka.<br1>
The mages say it's called Pailaka.<br1>
