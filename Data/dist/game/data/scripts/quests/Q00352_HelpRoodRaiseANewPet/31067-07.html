Ready to do this? Today is a lucky day for both of us! Let me repeat what I told you earlier about Lienrik.<br1>Both Lienrik and Lienrik Lads can be found in the <font color=LEVEL>Rest Area of the Animals</font>. Approach both carefully, as once can spew poison from a great distance.<br1>
Both kinds lay <font color=LEVEL>eggs</font>, but finding a female Lienrik is very rare.<br1>
Well, if you can do this for me, I'll make it worth your while -- I promise!<br1>
Even bringing back one would make my day!
