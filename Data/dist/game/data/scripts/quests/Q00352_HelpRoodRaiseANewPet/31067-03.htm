<html><body>Pet Manager Rood:<br1>
Lienriks are quite headstrong and hard to tame.<br1>The training must begin while it's still a baby. However, stealing one of its eggs is almost impossible. The mother of the species puts up a desperate fight, and even if you succeed in catching one, there's no guarantee that you can train it. It's not profitable at all for now. Not at all!<br1>
If I could get one of its eggs, at least I could try my best to train it. Wouldn't the ladies in town be impressed if I showed up with a tamed lienrik?<br1>
