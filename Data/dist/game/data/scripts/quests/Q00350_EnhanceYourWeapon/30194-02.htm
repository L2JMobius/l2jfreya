<html><body>Master Gideon:<br1>
I have a growing sense of dread of late. Something terrible is coming. Can you hear it? The trees in the forest, the birds in the sky and the fish in the ocean...They know of what I speak...<br1>
I fear for the survival of the whole Human race, but I don't know what threatens it! This dark foreboding will not give me any peace whatsoever. I hope I am wrong but I fear I am not...<br1>
I must do what I can to save my race! I will find like-minded individuals to join my preperations for the coming apocolypse. If only we knew when...<br1>
Will you join my cause? Are you willing to lend a hand in preparing to fight the imminent darkness?<br1>
