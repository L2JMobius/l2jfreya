To get the Stone of Commune, you must kill<font color=LEVEL> the Archon of Halisha</font>, either by entering the Four Sepulchers or by slaying evil monsters in the Shrine of the Loyal by the Wall of Argos.<br1>
Both paths will be difficult!<br1>
The fifth stone tablet is in the northwest corner of the Wall of Argos.</body></html>
