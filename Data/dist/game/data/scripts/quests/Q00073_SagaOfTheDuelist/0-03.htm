<html><body>Grand Master Sedrick:<br1>
 He's watched the games for generations!<br1>
 He says that only a<font color=LEVEL> warrior who seeks to venture beyond the horizon</font> will understand him. If you knew Iron's history, you'd understand...<br1>
But he criticized the Duelists and chose Sword Master Iron as the worst! I couldn't understand!<br1>
See the<font color=LEVEL> Arena Manager at the Coliseum</font> to find out more. He's the one who's pursuing this issue!<br1>
Take this document about Iron to him. I'm curious to find out what he thinks.</body></html>
