<html><body>Magister Kamilen:<br1>
Fairen didn't know that I'm conducting an investigation under the guise of Kamilen. In a letter I intercepted Fairen wanted Kamilen to discourage you from becoming a Storm Screamer! Don't worry, since I'm not bound to him I can still tell you what you need to do to become one.<br1>
