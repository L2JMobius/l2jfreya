Fairen got away, but I got the Stone of Commune! I'm not sure if she was trying to stop you or to guard the tablet.<br1>
Either way, she changed her mind and didn't put up a fight when she could have easily dealt with both of us. I'll have to find out from her.<br1>
At least you've succeeded!<br1>
Farewell! I must find her.<br1>
