This Map that you discovered on Alligator Island... Doesn't it make your heart pound just looking at it?<br1>
Ah, you want me to decipher it? Very well... But before I decipher the Map... first I must tell you the story of boatswain Muska, who betrayed Zaken, the great pirate. If you're going to search for Zaken's treasure, you should listen to the story first...<br1>
