<html><body>Totem Spirit of Gandi:<br1>
You stupid Orc! You're here to acquire the knowledge of the Totem Spirit, aren't you?<br1>
The knowledge of the Totem Spirit can only be handed down to those in the same tribe! Different tribes could never fully understand the Totem Spirit, they'd only acquire some fragmented pieces of knowledge.<br1>
Hum...<br1>
You may still want to acquire the knowledge of the Totem Spirit, even though you understand the limitations... As did most others... Am I correct? <br1>
