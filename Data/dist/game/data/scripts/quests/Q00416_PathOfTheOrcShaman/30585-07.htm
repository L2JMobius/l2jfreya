The language of flame cannot be taught, only learned. Confused? Ha!<br1>
If you wish to learn the language of flame, my young friend, you must summon the Hestui Totem Spirit. The spirit, who takes the form of a Kasha Bear, symbolizes dignity and wisdom.<br1>
Before attempting the summoning, however, you must first bring me a <font color=LEVEL>Kasha Bear Pelt and Kasha Bladespider Husk</font>. You must also hunt the <font color=LEVEL>Scarlet Salamander</font> and obtain one of its <font color=LEVEL>Fiery Eggs</font>.
