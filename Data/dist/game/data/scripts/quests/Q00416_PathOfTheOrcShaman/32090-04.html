<html><body>Dead Leopard's Carcass:<br1>
There's a strange song coming from somewhere. At last you discover the source: it issues from the mouth of a dead leopard.<br1>
The song sounds vaguely familiar yet somehow outlandish as well, like a song you might have heard a foreigner sing as a child.<br1><center>
[. . . Zakar Gandi! Tejakar Leopa!<br1>
O, forgotten song, lost amid the long tribal battles!<br1>
O, my fellow warriors, once a mighty army, now scattered to the winds!]<br1>
