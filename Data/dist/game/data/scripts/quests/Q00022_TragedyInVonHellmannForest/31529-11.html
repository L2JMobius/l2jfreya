Ok. Then, let's talk about the method. First, take this jewelry. If you hit the well, the spirits will come out.<br1>
While you are fighting with the spirits, I will break the seal of the hidden report in the well<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Just, don't kill the spirit while I'm working. Because they will come back to the well if they die.</font><br1>
If I break the seal, the color of the jewelry will change. After that, you can kill the spirit or do whatever you want. You got it?<br1>
