Please recover the <font color=LEVEL>crucifix</font> and <font color=LEVEL>rosary</font> that belonged to Priestess Agnes. This is essential if we are to give her a proper funeral.<br1>
You will find her remains on the south shore of Gludio. You should leave for there immediately! May the light of Einhasad guide your path...
