You also need to know about the <font color=LEVEL>Seed Collection</font>.<br1>
There are specific periods available for <font color=LEVEL>collection</font> depending upon each Seed's cycle. Since what you collect can usually be used as ingredients in my work, I'll give you Adena when you gather and bring any of the following:<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Fragment of Soul</font> collected from the <font color=LEVEL>Seed of Immortality</font>, the <font color=LEVEL>Breath of Tiat</font> collected from the <font color=LEVEL>Seed of Destruction</font>, and the <font color=LEVEL>Concentrated Spirit Energy</font> collected from the <font color=LEVEL>Seed of Annihilation</font>.<br1>
They are useless to you, so an exchange will benefit us both.<br1>
Do you understand?<br1>
