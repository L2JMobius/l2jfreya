Welcome, my comrade of the sword! I congratulate you on your safe return. How was your performance on the battlefield?<br1>
How truly amazing! You brought back another hundred badges! Magnificent! Ha ha! You have already proven your skills and have been acknowledged as a member of the Black Lions, and yet you still amaze me!<br1>
I received a letter that the brothers of the second platoon, who were dispatched to the south part of Gludio, will return later than planned. Our brothers here must hold on until they return. Go on back to the battlefield and fight, brother of the sword!<br1>
