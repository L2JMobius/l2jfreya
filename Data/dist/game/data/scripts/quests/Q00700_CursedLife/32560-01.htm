I manage this wharf and oversee the many tasks necessary to keep these airships coming and going. My job allows me the chance to look at the sky often. Sometimes, I feel like I spend all day looking up.<br1>
Can't say I dislike it. In fact, I used to daydream about flying as a child.<br1>
Sigh...that was such a long time ago. Who would have thought that things would change so much?<br1>
