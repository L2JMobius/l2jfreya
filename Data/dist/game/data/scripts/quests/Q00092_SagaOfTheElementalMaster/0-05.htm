<html><body>Grand Magister Arkenias:<br1>
There are no scrolls or books that contain the spell of ultimate summoning. That information has always been restricted to the gods, far beyond the grasp of mere Elves. The secret is supposedly written on six ancient tablets, in the language of the gods. The gods put these tablets in very out-of-the-way places, and stationed formidable beasts nearby to guard them.<br1>
If you can learn the secrets of the six tablets, you will pass the test. Luckily, there is someone who can help you... None less than the greatest Elemental Master of all time, Radyss!<br1>
