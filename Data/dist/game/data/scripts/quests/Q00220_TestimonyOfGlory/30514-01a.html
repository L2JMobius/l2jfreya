<html><body>Prefect Vokian:<br1>
Have you heard?  All of the Orc seers agree that an eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long...  We Orcs must prepare for dark days; days of chaos and destruction, dreadful days of endless war and disaster!<br1>
You must prepare yourself as well! First you must complete an occupation change!  This is no place for beginners.<br1>
(Quest only for Orc characters who have completed occupation change and are above level 37.)
