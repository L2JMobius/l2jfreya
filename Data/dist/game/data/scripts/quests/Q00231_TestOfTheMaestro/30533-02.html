Well, I can't go into details, but it concerns the delivery of a certain item. I don't know how the news leaked out, but it seems that every thief around here is targeting our wagon.<br1>
I have decided to hire some Guards. The Orcs are perfect for this job. <br1>But when I tried to hire them, the Orcs staying in the town would not listen!<br1>
Do you think you can go and persuade them? The Orc Leader's name is Croto or something like that. All I ask is that you extract a promise from them that they will send some of their mercenaries.
