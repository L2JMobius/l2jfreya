<html><body>Chief Croto:<br1>
I see.  My nephew died a hero's death.<br1>
I am jealous in a way... He was so tragically young.  His name will be inscribed forever in Pa'agrio's temple.<br1>
Now only bitter sorrow is left for this old man...<br1>
I must send reinforcements to Elder Balanki. Well done!
