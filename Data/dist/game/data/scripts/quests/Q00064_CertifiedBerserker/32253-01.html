Whew! Thank you, my friend! Thanks to you we were able to protect a legacy of the Kamael, Enuma Elish. We must make use of this brief respite to move it to a place of safety.<br1>
Eh? I see that you are one of the hopefuls in the Berserker class. If you continue on this path, I am certain we will meet again. Until then...<br1>
