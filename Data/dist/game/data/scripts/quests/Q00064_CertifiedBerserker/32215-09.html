We have avoided the brunt of the raiders' attack and are withdrawing secretly. However, they have dispatched a small force to alert the main enemy units of our location.<br1>
First, we must eliminate that force before they contact the main enemy group. They moved off to the west, so I contacted Master Entien in the Town of Dion to pursue them. You should go to Dion Castle Village and help in the pursuit.<br1>I will leave any messages from Harkilgamed beneath the bridge.<br1>
