You must gather <font color=LEVEL>20 light-blue runestones</font>. These runestones are obtained by destroying <font color=LEVEL>manashen gargoyles or enchanted stone golems</font> in the area near the Ivory Tower.  To protect their precious tower from interlopers, the mages apparently have inplanted runestones in the creatures of that area and are controlling them.<br1>This is all I will say on this matter. If you are a true hunter, you must gather the information and find the items yourself. Don't expect any more hints!<br1>
