On this Primeval Isle you'll find primitive creatures called dinosaurs -- you'll never see anything like them in Aden, believe me! According to wise wizards, even the gods and Giants were afraid of the dinosaurs. They cannot be found in Aden -- thankfully -- but are still plentiful on that strange island.<br1>
Around the wharf, you'll find only relatively weak ones, but they are still a challenge for even the hardiest adventurer.<br1>
The wizard Karakawei has been pestering me to acquire some of those creatures' bone for study. If you defeat them and bring back their bones, I will purchase them from you on his behalf. What do you say?<br1>
