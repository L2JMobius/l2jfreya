Please go and collect those dinosaur bones as quickly as possible. Karakawei's been pressing me even harder these days.<br1>
Without the bones, I think his research has ground to a halt.<br1>
He's planning to present his findings to the Mizbody Magic Association very soon, and I know he's getting anxious.<br1>
So get started!<br1>
Hunt the <font color=LEVEL>Pachycephalosaurus and wild striders</font> from the plains and bring back their <font color=LEVEL>bones</font>.
