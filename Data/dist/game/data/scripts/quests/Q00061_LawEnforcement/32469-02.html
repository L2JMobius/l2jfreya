I see -- Kekropus simply told you the history and left it to me to tell you the meaning of your existence...<br1>
Very well, then. First of all, what do you think Inspectors and Judicators are? Remember how you became an Inspector.<br1>
The composition of our race's bodies restricts Kamael males and females to different paths. In order for you to become an Inspector, you must be a child of the Kamael who is also born with <font color=LEVEL>Seeds of Chaos</font> -- a very rare occurrence.<br1>
Alternately, you must have the Seeds of Chaos in your hand. Do you?<br1>
