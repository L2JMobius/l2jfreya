Well done! As promised, I will reward you based on the number and types of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins. What are these memos ...? This paper is used by Dwarven Guilds when writing <font color=LEVEL>official documents</font> ... Also, the handwriting is Dwarvish ...<br1>
This means those insolent goblins were in <font color=LEVEL>secret communication</font> with one of us Dwarves ...! How can this be ...! This must be a plot by one of the other guilds to destroy our business!<br1>
Look here, my friend. <font color=LEVEL>Please find rest of these memos!</font> That's the only way to reveal the truth behind this secret plot! I'll give you more than enough reward, never you worry about that!<br1>
