I welcome you in the name of Shilen, child of darkness. So you are a Palus Knight in training who received the <font color=LEVEL>Trial of the Red Coffin</font> from Master Virgil.<br1>
To complete the trial, you must make your own <font color=LEVEL>Coffin of Eternal Rest</font>. This is not the crude wooden coffin, made by humans to bury their corpses in the backyard of their temples. This is a traditional Dark Elf coffin made with the carapace of a beast and the silk threads of a spider. The materials needed to make this coffin are all very rare, and the process of searching for the materials itself is a part of the trial. Therefore, you must find the materials yourself.<br1>
