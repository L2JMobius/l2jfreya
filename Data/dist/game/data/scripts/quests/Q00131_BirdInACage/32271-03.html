<html><body>Water Dragon's Shamaness Parme:<br1>
(As she listens, the Shamaness continues to tenderly hold her head in her hands.)<br1>
Uhh... Uhh...<br1>
...<br1>
Ahh! I remember everything now.<br1>
Thank you very much.<br1>
There is so much to tell, but...<br1>
It would be best to leave this place first.<br1>
I will go to a secret location to take care of a number of tasks for the Water Dragon that cannot be delayed.<br1>
I am sorry to not be able to tell you more, even after you saved me.<br1>
But it is that important...<br1>
I will teleport you outside.<br1>
(The Shamaness begins to write a letter.)<br1>
Please deliver this letter to <font color=LEVEL>Kanis</font>.<br1>
We must go now!<br1>
(The Shamaness concentrates for a moment and then begins chanting a spell.)<br1>
