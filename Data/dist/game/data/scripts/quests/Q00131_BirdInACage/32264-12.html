<html><body>Priest Kanis:<br1>
They say that a monster named <font color=LEVEL>Balor</font> rules over the <font color=LEVEL>Water Dragon's Cave</font>.<br1>
I believe that Balor guards the place where the Shamaness is being held captive.<br1>
If that is the case, you will only be able reach the Shamaness by defeating Balor.<br1>
That creature is said to be far stronger and more frightening than ordinary monsters, so please be careful...<br1>
