I will prepare 3 solutions if you bring me the Dark Crystal.<br1>
One of the 3 solutions will be able to produce the Dark Oxide.<br1>
Unfortunately, I cannot yet produce perfect solutions every time.<br1>
What you will need to do is choose one of these 3 solutions and then place 5 Dark Crystals in it.<br1>
