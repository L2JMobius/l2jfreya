(Reads the documents carefully.)<br1>
Hmm... Good job...<br1>
I will analyze the information you collected and draft further orders for you...<br1>
(Master Gobie scribbles a note.)<br1>
Here, take this letter to <font color=LEVEL>Captain Bathis of the Town of Gludio</font> and return to me.<br1>
While you deliver this,<br1>
I will dispatch our elite Xekerin Troops to capture Tak, a staff officer of the Ol Mahum.<br1>
Go quickly!
