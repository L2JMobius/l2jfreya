Hmm... We have lost contact with the Xekerin Troops. That is not necessarily unusual during an operation, but they have remained out of contact longer this time...<br1>
Still, since they are all elite warriors, I am not overly concerned...yet.<br1>
I do have an another document for you to deliver.<br1>
Take this to <font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Tobias of the Dark Elf Guild in the Town of Gludio</font> and return.
