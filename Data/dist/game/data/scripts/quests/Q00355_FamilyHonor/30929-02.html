Why, you find the true value of the item! To the untrained eye, an antique like this may seem rather ordinary. But to an expert like myself, each subtle mark and worn surface tells a story. The materials and techniques used in its manufacture are revealed to me.<br1>
The different aspects will determine the true value of the statue. Statues that are appraised to be <font color=LEVEL>prototypes</font> or <font color=LEVEL>genuine</font> are the most valuable.<br1>
If the appraisal shows that the statue is an  <font color=LEVEL>imitation</font> or a <font color=LEVEL>forgery</font>, its value will be minimal. Sometimes it is better to skip the appraisal altogether.<br1>
