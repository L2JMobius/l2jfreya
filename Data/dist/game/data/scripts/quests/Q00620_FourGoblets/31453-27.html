They were my royal guards, Alectia, Tishas, Mekara and Morigul! I thought I'd make them stronger than ever to protect myself and my treasures. I was not thinking too clearly at that time! So I gave them over to the demon, with catastrophic results!<br1>
Well, we can't let all your hard work go to waste! My friends may not be many, but I can trust them! They'll help me undo the damage I've done! If we are to restore the four sepulchers, I must confront my own demons!<br1>
