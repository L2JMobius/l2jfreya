<html><body>Nameless Spirit:<br1>
The nobles who unknowingly came here to worship were cruelly massacred by evil creatures. Maybe we could get the passes from their corpses!<br1>
They won't be easy to find, however. The <font color=LEVEL>ghost of an adventurer</font> that haunts the gate of the Imperial graveyard will give us one if we do him a favor. The passes can only be used once, so you should get a few.<br1>
The pass isn't the only requirement for entry, though!<br1>
