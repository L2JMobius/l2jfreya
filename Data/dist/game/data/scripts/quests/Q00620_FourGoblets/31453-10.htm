Naturally, I have a plan! After you defeat the shadows of Halisha, <font color=LEVEL>my friend will come and let you out</font>. He'll teleport you to the Pilgrim's Temple and open the Sealed Boxes for you.<br1>
My companion doesn't care for the shadows of Halisha, and he won't show up until they're all dead. Basically, you must defeat all the shadows if you are to escape! <font color=LEVEL>Don't forget to ask my friend to open all the boxes when you meet him</font>.<br1>
