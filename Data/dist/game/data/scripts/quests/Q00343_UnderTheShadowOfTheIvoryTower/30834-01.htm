<html><body>Magic Trader Cema:<br1>
We need someone to gather materials for a research project that is being conducted at Hardin's Academy. It is imperative that this person be cognizant of the forces of magic. If you know a well-trained Mystic, send him to me.<br1>
(This quest can only be undertaken by non-Orc Mystics level 40 or higher.)
