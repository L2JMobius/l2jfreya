Hey, hey! Settle down! We can discuss this, can't we? It was merely a harmless prank, and I'm sure you appreciate the humor - hey, that hurts!<br1>
The truth? Very well. I can see I have no choice; your grim faces suggest no love of my jest. Visitor's Day is a lie. We use that as a ruse to attract live sacrifices.<br1>
A little embarrassing to be found out like this, really. But what's important is that you made it out. To be honest, it's been a long time since I've seen anyone escape the temple. You must be very powerful adventurers. I could use a favor...<br1>
