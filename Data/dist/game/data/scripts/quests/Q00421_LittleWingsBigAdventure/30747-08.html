The four fairy trees are connected. Their roots traverse unimaginable depths to touch the Mother Tree Glade in the Elven Forest. The Essence of Wind, star, twilight and the abyss respectively flow within the trunks of these trees... These elements are essential for a hatchling to mature properly...Legend says that these trees were planted long ago by King Raul after he met the Lady of the Lake.
