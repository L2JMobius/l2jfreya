<html><body>Shilen Priest Lelrikia:<br1>
The Dark Black Dragon was a follower of Shilen and widely regarded as one of the most powerful Dragons in existence. But it is imprisoned just like the goddess herself... That's the official history. But how can you explain the Seed of Destruction if the Dragon's power remains inaccesible? It is foolish to imagine that such power can be forever imprisoned.<br1>
I do not know much about Tiat, but it is obvious that her power was inherited form the Dark Black Dragon.<br1>
