Oh my ...<font color=LEVEL>I'm deeply touched!</font> I've never been this touched before! You brought the Spider Silk! Thank you very, very much! This is the reward, as promised. Please take it ... I still need more Spider Silk, so please collect more!<br1>
But making twenty dresses will take forever ... What should I do? Maybe I should run away to another village? Oh no! I don't know what to do!!!<br1>
