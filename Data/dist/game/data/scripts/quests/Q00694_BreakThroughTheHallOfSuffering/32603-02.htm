I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there.<br1>
The Hall of Suffering consists of 5 consecutive rooms. Each room has a <font color=LEVEL>Tumor of Death</font> guarded by various monsters.<br1>
You must deactivate this Tumor. Once you have done so, it will become a <font color=LEVEL>Destroyed Tumor</font>.<br1>
Of course, the monsters will try to stop you. Once the Tumors in all 5 rooms are deactivated, you may proceed.<br1>
But I leave it up to you wherher to face the monsters or the Tumors first. Remember, even if you destroy the Tumor, the nearbly monsters won't simply disappear.
