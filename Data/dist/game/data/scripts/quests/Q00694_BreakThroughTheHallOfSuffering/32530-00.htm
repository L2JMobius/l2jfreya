I'm very impressed.<br1>
No one has ever broken through this fast to the Hall of Suffering. Extraordinary! In recognition of your achievement, I will give you a <font color=LEVEL>Jewel Ornamented Duel Supplies</font>.<br1>
It is granted only to those who achieve an especially impressive feat in battle.<br1>
Your leader may receive it on your behalf.
