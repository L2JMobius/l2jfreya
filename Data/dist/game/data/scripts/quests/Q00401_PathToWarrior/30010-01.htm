<html><body>Master Auron:<br1>
Now I'm a master who teaches young Fighters, but I was once a soldier for the <font color=LEVEL>Warrior League</font>, walking the borderline between of life and death on the battlefield.<br1>
To be accepted into the Warrior League, there's no need for a noble birth or the lord's Recommendation. We accept any Fighter who has courage and spirit.<br1>
