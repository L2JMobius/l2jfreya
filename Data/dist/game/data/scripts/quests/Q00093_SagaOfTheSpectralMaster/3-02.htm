 First you must meet with<font color=LEVEL> Messenger Wahkan</font> of the Ketra Orcs.They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to gain their trust!<br1>
<font color=LEVEL> Soul Guide Asefa</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Ketra Orcs has a<font color=LEVEL> Divine Stone of Wisdom</font> that we simply must have!<br1>
 If things don't go well with the Ketras, you should try the Varka Silenos tribe. They also have a stone. Good luck!</body></html>
