Ah, my young adventurer... So, did you have a look around this Primeval Isle? As you probably know already, there are many unique creatures on this island. There is also an ancient race of men, the Elroki tribe. Though they may seem primitive to your eyes in some respects, do not underestimate them! Theirs is a culture rich in history and tradition, and they have skills unknown to more "civilized" races. How else could they have survived all these years surrounded by these vicious dinosaurs?<br1>
