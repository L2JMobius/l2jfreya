<html><body>Lady of the Lake:<br1>
Don't you know who I am?<br1>
My mother lost everything that she loved, and her grief over the betrayal was overpowering. I am the child who holds hope and faith in the future. Some call me the Goddess of Water, but that title really belongs to my sister. My name is Eva.<br1>
I will give my trust to a mortal over my own siblings, if they recite with conviction, and believe in that new future. Can you do that?<br1>
