Each tribe has a chief shaman who also serves as a guide of dead souls. Asefa serves the Ketra Orcs and Udan Mardui serves the Varka Silenos. Each one possesses a<font color=LEVEL> Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>. They are vaguely aware of its power, but have no idea how to use it. They actually give it away as a prize to whomever they consider the wisest of their respective tribes! You must gain their trust and get the stone. Bring it to me, and I'll combine it with the stone that Agnes gave me to create a Stone of Commune.<br1>
The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos are currently at war with each other, so you must choose which tribe to approach.<br1>
