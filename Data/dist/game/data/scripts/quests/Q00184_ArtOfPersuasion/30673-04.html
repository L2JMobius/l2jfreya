I think we searched the entire 1st floor after comparing my information to Nikola's map. The place we were in danger was somewhere on the 2nd floor. Nikola said that he was examining some broken devices in the front with help from the keeper, but he couldn't determine their exact purpose because of the monster attack. I suppose that's the place we want -- will you go there and check it out?<br1>
