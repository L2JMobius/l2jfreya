You've worked hard to acquire basic control of the game. Now your adventures may begin in earnest!<br1>
I have a gift to assist you as you begin your journey. You know how to use it, right?<br1>
You also now have a choice to make. Will you develop your skills in the Dwarven Village? Or will you improve your abilities by traveling to the Isle of Souls like the Kamael?<br1>
