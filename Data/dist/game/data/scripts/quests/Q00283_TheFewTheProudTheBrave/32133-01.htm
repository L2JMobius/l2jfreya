<html><body>Vice Hierarch Perwan:<br1>
The moment you entered, your determination shone forth like a bright blade. I have a task perfectly suited for your abilities.<br1>
Recently, I received a report that many people have been attacked by Crimson Spiders near Mimir's Forest. Since the road that connects the town and Nornil's Cave runs through the forest, we cannot simply close it to traffic.<br1>
We must clear out the Crimson Spiders, and I am responsible for recruiting people for a militia in order to do so. I think you would be a great help to the effort -- will you do it? Naturally, if you capture the Crimson Spiders, you will receive a generous reward...<br1>
