I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there.<br1>
You will enter Hall of Erosion, which consists of a interconnected set of 8 rooms. There are <font color=LEVEL>Tumors of Death</font> in 4 of those rooms. You must destroy those Tumors.<br1>
Once you have done so, <font color=LEVEL>Cohemenes</font> will appear.
