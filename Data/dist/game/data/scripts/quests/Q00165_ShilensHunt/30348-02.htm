In a few days the <font color=LEVEL>mass of darkness</font> dedicated to Shilen and Gran Kain will be held. <font color=LEVEL>Shilen's Hunt</font> will be held for ten days before the mass. The purpose of this ceremony is to hunt wild animals in the name of the goddess and offer them as a sacrifice at the sanctuary. Of course, the act of offering a sacrifice is only symbolic -- in the past, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies for the winter during our long period of hiding in the darkness.<br1>
The hunt has already begun! The youth of the village are in the woods and on the hunt, armed with swords and bows. The fervor is impressive -- the Humans who witnessed it called it the "wild hunt." I think you should also hurry and participate in the hunt to honor the mother of the abyss!<br1>
