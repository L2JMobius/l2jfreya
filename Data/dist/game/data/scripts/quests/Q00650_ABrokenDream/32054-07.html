Ah, that doesn't surprise me. Did any of the ghosts show you a dream fragment?<br1>
What they showed you was our forgotten dream, the dream we tried to realize even after our death and failed, our hopeless dream...<br1>
Well, that's how the world is. If you fail at achieving something in your lifetime, it is better to give it up than to carry the regret to your grave. What can I do as a ghost, other than to bother people like you?<br1>
My poor friends... they had no idea that it would come to this.<br1>
So, do you want to exchange that dream fragment for our keepsake? Or do you want to give up now? I am warning you in advance, the dream fragment is all but useless... <font color=LEVEL>If you tell me you want to give up, then I will simply fade away...</font><br1>
