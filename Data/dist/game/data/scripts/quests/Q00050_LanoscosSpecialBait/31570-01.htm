Some time ago, I caught a few strange boxes while fishing. I thought it was strange to catch so many things that weren't fish! I quickly learned that some people will pay very well for these boxes! I think they're intrigued by the mystery of what's inside...<br1>
You must use a special bait to recover items from the water. This special bait uses the magical attraction of elements to change the polarity of sunken items and raise them to the surface! I mention this because I think you may be good at it!<br1>
