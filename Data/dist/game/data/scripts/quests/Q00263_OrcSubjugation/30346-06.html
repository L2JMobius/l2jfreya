You have fought very well. In the name of Tetrarch Vellior, I will give you a reward for every balor Orc that you strike down. Those who fight on behalf of the race of darkness will reap a rich reward for their bravery.<br1>
But the battle is not over yet. The foreign invaders still lurk in our woods! Will you go back into the battlefield, or will you stop fighting now?<br1>
