Young Shaman of the tribe, you shall remember! At one time we ruled the world and brought others to their knees before our awesome power... You must never forget! Our cities burned and our people killed by our enemies... You must remember!<br1>
You who will take the Test of the Lord! If you wish to be recognized as possessing the qualifications of the Lord, you must know the true meaning of the totem which we, the Urutu tribe, serve.<br1>
