<html><body>Atuba Chief Varkees:<br1>
Welcome back, young Shaman! I have already heard how you slew those dishonorable Orcs near Giran. I hope the experience of killing your fellow Orcs has shown you how ruthless we Atuba can be.<br1>
Truly, you have earned the Pointed Fang Totem. I, Varkees of the Atuba, salute your skill and fighting spirit!
