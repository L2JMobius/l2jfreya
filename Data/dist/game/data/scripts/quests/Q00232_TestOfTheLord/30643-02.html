<html><body>First Orc:<br1>
They were obviously jealous of the fact that that I, the First Orc, was much stronger than their puny creations. When Pa'agrio ordered me here, they schemed to use the abundant water of this earth to extinguish my inner fire, to harden the lava that flows in my veins.<br1>With my last dying breath I gave birth to the fathers of the 7 tribes, in whom I imbued my powers of honor and flame.  They also received my secrets of strength through endless training. This same character is within you.  Never ignore the spiritual flame that burns within...<br1>
