Ah? So, the dinosaurs themselves contain some fragments of Gazkh?<br1>
I suppose that it is possible...if the ax was broken and the fragments were scattered by the force Shilen used to seal Sailren.<br1>
The predator dinosaurs here have skin harder than iron -- I doubt they would ever feel the fragments embedded in their hides. In fact, the very power of Gazkh has probably greatly extended their lifespans.<br1>
You who contain an ancient Elrokian spirit, you are the only one who can hunt those dinosaurs and bring back the Gazkh fragments.<br1>
Choose now. Will you attempt to recover the fragments?<br1>
