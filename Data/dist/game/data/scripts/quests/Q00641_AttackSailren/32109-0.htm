<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br1>
I am Shilen's avatar.<br1>
Shilen commanded me to watch over this island and protect it from evil beings.<br1>
The duty is growing increasingly difficult. But I have prayed to Shilen and she has decreed that she would send a warrior who can defeat the threat we face.<br1>
Are you the one? No... You are too weak to be the warrior mother Shilen spoke of.<br1>
