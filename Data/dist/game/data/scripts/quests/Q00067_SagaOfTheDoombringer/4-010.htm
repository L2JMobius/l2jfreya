Mmm... Enuma Elish was a sword originally forged with the power to cut the gods themselves. It was used to wond Einhasad 
herself, which is why she will not rest until she finds it. Because of that, I, who know the sowrd's true whereabouts, am 
continually pursued by Einhasad's followers.<br1>
I do not understand why they have struck here and now, though. I must pursue Einhasad's follower -- I wish to interrogate him...<br1>
