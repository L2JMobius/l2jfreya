You have returned! How is Mason? Please tell me everything...<br1>
...You say with your mouth that he is living happily, but the expression on your face says something else.  You must tell me the truth!<br1>
...What! Never could I have imagined that he would be living a lonely, wretched life after losing all his family during the assault of Gracia... Perhaps his grief would be less severe now, since you have completed his revenge.<br1>
A Warrior must share the pain of his comrade, but still cannot stop fighting. It is time for you to fight once more.<br1>
