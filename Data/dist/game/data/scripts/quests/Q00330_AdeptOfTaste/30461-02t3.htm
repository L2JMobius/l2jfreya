Is this Jonas' cooking? I tasted his cooking last month. He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas. His cooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is ... inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br1>
Oh! It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ...?<br1>
It is monster eye meat! How did he think to cook it into a steak? What a unique idea. The taste is very good. It would have been better if the sauce were a little richer ... The salad goes well with the meat, but it is not that fresh. There are a few flaws, but overall, I am pleased. A little improvement will make it a magnificent dish.<br1>
I will give you this letter with my review. Please give it to <font color=LEVEL>Jonas</font>. And tell him that I look forward to finer cuisine in the future.
