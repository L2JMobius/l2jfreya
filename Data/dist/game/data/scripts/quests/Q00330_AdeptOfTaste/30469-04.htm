I see that you have not yet been able to gather the five ingredients I requested.<br1>
But there is no need to rush. A dish's flavor depends on how much care was given in gathering the ingredients. If you use just any ingredient, the dish will not be tasty, no matter how well you cook it.<br1>
If you've forgotten which ingredients you must get from whom, ask me again.<br1>
