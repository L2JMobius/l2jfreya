I buried the gold in Dion's southern forest. We made a map to the place, divided it into 4 pieces, and took 1 piece each. It meant none of us could return there without the others...<br1>
I first knew the gold was cursed when I heard about the unfortunate deaths of my 3 comrades.  So I decided to forget it all and live quietly here.<br1>
