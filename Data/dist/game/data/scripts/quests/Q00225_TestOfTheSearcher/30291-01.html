Welcome, my friend.  If Master Luther sent you here you must be ready to get to work.<br1>
Floran Village needs more good workers like you. We don't have a guard or even a single skilled person!<br1>
I have been waiting for you since I received the warrant of appointment.  Take this and give it to my adjutant <font color=LEVEL>Militia Leirynn</font>...<br1>
She is a modest lady. I am afraid that work here may not be as easy as you think... I thank you in advance.<br1>
