<html><body>Beast Herder Tunatun:<br1>
Everyone knows that the best meat can only be found from the animals on this land. I've done all I can to keep them safe, but these Sel Mahum <font color=LEVEL>Farm Ravagers and Farm Bandits</font> are starting to be too much for me. In fact, I would be overwhelmed if they all attacked at once. There wouldn't be anything I could do to protect my life's work.<br1>
When everything a man knows is threatened... how can he find his peace?<br1>
