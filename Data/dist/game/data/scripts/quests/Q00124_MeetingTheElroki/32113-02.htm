The conflict between Humans and Elrokians began when the explorers built this wharf and maintained a presence here.<br1>
Our two races are divided by differences in culture and language; what seems normal to one is often strange, even offensive, to the other. Despite my efforts to teach both sides to live together in harmony, misunderstandings are common. Blood has been spilled on more than one occasion, and the peace that now exists here is fragile at best.<br1>
The Humans see the Elroki tribe as nothing more than violent savages, while the Elrokians see Humans as invaders. How can either side learn to respect the other?<br1>
I tell you this because you seem to have no prejudice against the Elroki tribe -- will you help me help them?<br1>
