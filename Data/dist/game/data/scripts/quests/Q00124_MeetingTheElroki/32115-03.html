Perhaps you should listen to this story to better understand the situation. You have already heard the tale of how my father and Marquez met, haven't you?<br1>
The <font color=LEVEL>Lost Nest</font> where they met is a very important place for the Elroki tribe.<br1>
According to legend, it is the place where the goddess of water, Shilen, the mother and founder of this Primeval Island, blessed the Elrokians, transforming them into the bravest warriors the world has ever known.<br1>
