I hate to admit it, but Wererats are in fact as gifted as Dwarves when it comes to mining. They can move around in total darkness like it was noon, and small spaces don't bother them at all. Since that evil aura has descended on the mine, our Dwarven miners have been unable to do their work. We've been forced to rely on the Wererats to mine the minerals, but now they refuse to give them to us.<br1>
I need you to go defeat the Wererats and bring back the minerals they mined! I will reward you for hunting them and for returning with the mined material.<br1>
What do you say? Will you do it?<br1>
