This is a serious issue -- even at full strength, the mine barely keeps pace with the demand for mithril. With much of it closed and our miners afraid to enter...<br1>
But we of the Gray Pillar Guild don't intend to simply accept this new state of affairs.<br1>
We do need capable adventurers willing to help us cleanse the Mithril Mine. Interested?<br1>
