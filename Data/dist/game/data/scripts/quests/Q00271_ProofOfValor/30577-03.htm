<html><body>Praetorian Rukain:<br1>
I truly cannot stand novices these days! They still smell like milk, but they go around like great lords ...! If I were not a praetorian, I would knock down all those saucy rascals with one swing of my fist. That might start their wits running.<br1>
Hey! Are you glaring at me, youngster? You look offended because I disregard you. Hey, listen! If you don't want to be treated like a novice, you have no choice but to prove to me that you are an excellent fighter.<br1>
