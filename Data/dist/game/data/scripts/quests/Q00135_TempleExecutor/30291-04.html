A number of goods -- about 10 items total -- have been stolen from Warehouse Keeper Sonin's warehouse.<br1>
During my investigation, I narrowed the list of suspects down to 5 creatures: <font color=LEVEL>Delu Lizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers</font>.<br1>
Find the thief, recover the <font color=LEVEL>10</font> <font color=LEVEL>Stolen Cargo</font> items and return them to Sonin.<br1>
Then I am sure he will, in gratitude, provide you with the letter of reference.<br1>
