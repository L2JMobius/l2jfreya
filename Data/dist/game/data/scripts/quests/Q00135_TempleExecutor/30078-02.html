<html><body>Grocer Pano:<br1>
Oh, you are the adventurer from the association. Thank the goddess!<br1>
Listen, I'm in a real fix. My business has struggled lately, so I borrowed some money from some people I shouldn't have. Now they've raised the interest so much that I can't afford to pay them back!<br1>
I begged them to have mercy on me, but they just laughed -- then they told me, sneering, that they would write off my debt if only I bring them 10 Hate Crystals.<br1>
But how can a peaceful trader like me deal with the dangerous monsters who have the Crystals?<br1>
You look like a strong and resourceful adventurer -- would you help me? Please, I beg you...<br1>
Alex can give you more information about the monsters who have the <font color=LEVEL>Hate Crystals</font>.
