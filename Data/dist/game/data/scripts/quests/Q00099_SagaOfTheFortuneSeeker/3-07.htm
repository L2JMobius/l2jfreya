You can feel the Stone of Commune? It must be this small piece of stone that I stole from the Benandantis. It's the fragment of the fourth Stone of Commune. However, for it to work properly, we have to find the missing piece and put them together.<br1>
The rest of the Stone of Commune is called the sacred stone of wisdom and is worshiped as an idol by the uncivilized tribes in this area. The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos each have one. To get the stone from them, you must first win their trust. Since they are wild and warlike, I don't know which tribe you should approach.<br1>
