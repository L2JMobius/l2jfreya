Dammit, Sharon! I came here for a rest, but I keep having to deal with customers! Could you please handle them from now on?<br1>

You're too late! I already sold that information to the Benandanti Cartel. Made a pretty penny, too, I must say! Of course, I'm perfectly willing to give you the same information for the right price. Ha!<br1>
