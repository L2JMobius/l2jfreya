I see that you have brought the empty Book of Seal. With this, all our preparations are completed!<br1>
While you were gone, I made an infusion using the Stabilized Ectoplasm and Mimir's Elixir.<br1>
Drink this and your soul should be able to endure the transformation process.<br1>
Not nervous, are you? I suppose that technically you are the first to attempt this, but I am entirely confident in my theory, and you seem a hardy, healthy specimen.<br1>
