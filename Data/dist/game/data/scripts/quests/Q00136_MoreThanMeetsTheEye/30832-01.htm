Among Shilen's creatures, there are those who are able to change their appearance to terrorize and attack people.<br1>
As a Necromancer, I am naturally very interested in such abilities. What if their power could be utilized as a kind of magic?<br1>
...<br1>
Why do I research transformation magic?<br1>
At the core, it is because I am curious about lifeforms and knowledge -- I want to understand all knowledge, power and magic under the sun.<br1>
Ha ha...<br1>
...<br1>
Hmm...<br1>
Actually, this <font color=LEVEL>Transformation Magic</font> is almost complete.<br1>
...<br1>
But in order to transform, the soul must first be prepared.<br1>
I am still researching that final component... Frankly, I could use some assistance.<br1>
