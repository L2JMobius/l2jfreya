>Wait...did you say that you have come for Stabilized Ectoplasm?<br1>
There are not many magicians these days who deal with ectoplasm, which is composed of filthy and unpleasant souls...<br1>

Ah, you undoubtedly will not wish to divulge to me your purpose for this ectoplasm...<br1>
Well, I do not know what kind of necromantic magic you are experimenting with, but it must be a challenging task.<br1>
