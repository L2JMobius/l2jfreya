Ha! An adventurer after my own heart... Don't try to satisfy your curiosity in one gulp, though.<br1>
If we make progress with these experiments, I'm sure all of your questions will be answered.<br1>
At this stage in my research, I absolutely require <font color=LEVEL>Stabilized Ectoplasm</font>.<br1>
I have learned that it can be obtained from <font color=LEVEL>Dark Elf Magister Errickin in Hunters Village</font>, but I cannot leave my experiment at the moment.<br1>
Will you go in my place, obtain it and bring it back here?
