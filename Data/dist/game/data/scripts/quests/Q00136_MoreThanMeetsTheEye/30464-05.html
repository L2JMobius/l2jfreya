Ah, you've brought all the Glass Jaguar Crystals! I will craft a blank Sealbook right away...<br1>
(Clayton begins to craft a blank Sealbook using a number of arcane materials.<br1>
After grinding down the Glass Jaguar Crystals, he liquifies them and uses the solution to engrave each side of the frame of the blank Sealbook.)<br1>
All right, it's all finished. I must admit that I'm very curious to discover how effective this magical medium will be. I suspect you're experimenting with a new spell -- I wish you success!
