<html><body>Detention Camp Warden:<br1>
Enter the fortress dungeon and slay the prisoners you find there.<br1>
Your task is to eliminate the <font color=LEVEL>3 groups</font> so that the remaining evil creatures can be destroyed. Kill the leader of the <font color=LEVEL>last group</font>, and bring back the <font color=LEVEL>Dungeon Leader Mark</font>.<br1>
In return, I'll give you the Knight's Epaulette, which you can use to exchange the clan's supplies from a supply general.<br1>
The dungeon leaders we've identified so far are <font color=LEVEL>Brand the Exile, Commander Koenig and Gerg the Hunter</font>.<br1>
I can admit you to the fortress dungeon right now.<br1>
