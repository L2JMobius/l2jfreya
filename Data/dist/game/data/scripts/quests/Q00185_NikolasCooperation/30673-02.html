What? Misunderstanding?<br1>
What is that old man talking about? That's absurd...<br1>
But he said he would help us, eh? It's certainly not like him to lend us his precious map.<br1>
I'm still angry at him, but now I have to admit I'm curious enough about his motives to talk to him again...<br1>
In any case, show me the map! I want to study it to see exactly where we should search.<br1>
