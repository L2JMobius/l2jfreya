Say, you may not have heard, but there is <font color=LEVEL>a new type of armor available â€” but only for members of the clan academy</font>. Would you like to have a suit of it? I can make one for you...<br1>
Oh, wait, I fear you don't meet the prerequisites. I'm sorry.<br1>
(Only level 19 and higher characters who are clan academy members, and who have a sponsor, are permitted to take on the quest.)
