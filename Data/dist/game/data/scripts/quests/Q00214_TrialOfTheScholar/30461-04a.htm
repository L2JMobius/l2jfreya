Very well. You must meet with well-respected scholar mystics and complete the tasks they give you in order to qualify.<br1>
First, visit <font color=LEVEL>High Priest Sylvain</font>. He has studied the cleansing power of light more deeply than anyone else and oversees the spiritual cleansing of Dion territory. Rumor has it that he even assisted the Elves in their previous attempts to cleanse the Sea of Spores.<br1>
Bear this mark to him and he will give you an appropriate task. When he have accomplished it, return to me.<br1>
Finally, accept this <font color=LEVEL>Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
