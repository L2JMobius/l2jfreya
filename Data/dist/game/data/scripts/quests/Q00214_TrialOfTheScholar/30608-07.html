It wasn't very much different from any other day. I was alone, daydreaming as usual. As always, my thoughts eventually returned to that horrible day...<br1>
Then my childhood friend Lucilla came to visit. We went out together and I had more fun than I have in years.  We stayed the night in Gludin.  The next morning we parted, going to our respective homes. When I got there my house had been ransacked and the scroll stolen from its locker. The only thing undisturbed was Lucilla's Handbag that she left behind.<br1>
