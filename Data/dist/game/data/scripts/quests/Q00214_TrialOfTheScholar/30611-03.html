Sob...hiccup~! My poor friends...?<br1>
Hiccup~ yes, it was the time that Despe.., he told us to steal the books from that difficult man. He offered us a tidy sum of money for them, too. Burp~!<br1>
But you see, we discovered that these were extraordinary books!  Hiccup~!<br1>
So we decided to keep them for ourselves. Hiccup~ First we went to my brother's house and split up the books and then went our separate ways.<br1>
We promised to reunite when things calmed down. Hiccup~ Now my friends will never return...sob...sob~<br1>
