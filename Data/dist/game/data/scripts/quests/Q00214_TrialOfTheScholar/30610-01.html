Running errands for Mirien, are you? How are those greenhorns? Aren't they annoying when they ask you to do this and that? They call themselves High Priest or Grand Magister or whatever, but only their words are courageous.<br1>
They probably don't even know any great magic... All of their 'knowledge' has come from books, they have no practical experience. 'That's the way of a Sorcerer' doesn't ring so true anymore, does it?<br1>
OK, I'll ask you just one more time... Why do you want to learn magic?<br1>
