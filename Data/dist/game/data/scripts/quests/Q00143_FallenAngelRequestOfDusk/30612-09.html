<html><body>Elder Casian:<br1>
To find the fallen angel, climb to the <font color=LEVEL>Weathered Rock</font> in the wilderness and sing a song of praise from the prophecy.<br1>
Once the medicine has done its work, you will be able to speak with the angel.<br1>
I have marked the location of the Weathered Rock on your map, adventurer.<br1>
Good luck!
