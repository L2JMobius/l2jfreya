I do not know the angel's location, but we have been requested to search for something called the <font color=LEVEL>Sealed Prophecy: Path of the God</font>.<br1>
Your predecessor has already secured it...<br1>They think it contains clues to the whereabouts of the angel.<br1>
Apparently, once the angel is located, its message can be recorded using a unique Echo Crystal...<br1>
Now, go to <font color=LEVEL>Grand Master Tobias in the town of Gludio</font> and ask him about the matter...<br1>
Here, take the Sealed Prophecy: Path of the God with you...
