Yes, the prophecies seemed to predict the arrival of the fallen angel through a series of metaphors.<br1>
My knowledge is limited, but I will do my best to divine their true meaning.<br1>
In fact, if I remember correctly, the prophecies even mention that an unknown adventurer helps the angel...<br1>
By using the place mentioned in the prophecies as a clue, I believe I may be able to determine the angel's location...<br1>
