<html><body>Fallen Angel:<br1>
Humans were actually created by Einhasad's chaos-loving mate, the dissipated Gran Kain. In pledging their allegiance to Einhasad, they have suppressed their natural desire for freedom and independence.<br1>
They became pawns in a game beyond their understanding...<br1>
I find the whole situation both ludicrous and sad.<br1>
I cannot understand why Mother would do such a thing, much less allow it to continue for so long.<br1>
