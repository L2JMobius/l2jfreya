Ah, I had every confidence that you would succeed! Well done!<br1>
However, we still cannot officially denounce the hypocrisy of the Temple or the Rulers of Dawn.<br1>
The nobility will never see the proof we lay before them...not yet, at any rate.<br1>
But your service to our cause will not be forgotten, that I promise you!
