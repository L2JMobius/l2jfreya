Recently, there have been <font color=LEVEL>rumors of a girl near Gludin Harbor that performs miracles</font>. We suspect that perhaps this girl may have the power to purify the world.<br1>
If that girl is truly the sacred flame mentioned in the prophecy, we must protect her. I have heard that there are already those who are using the prophecy of the sacred flame to hatch sinister plots. First, bring the girl to us.<br1>
Oh yes! Take this crystal necklace. It will aid you in revealing whether or not she is truly the sacred flame of the prophecy.
