<html><body>Captain Bathis:<br1>
The favor I ask is on behalf of <font color=LEVEL>Magister Rohmer</font> of the Temple of Einhasad. The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Rohmer is a member, are researching the Kaneus: recently discovered monsters of Kamaloka.<br1>
They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the Kaneus.<br1>
They do not know the cause of this mutation, however.<br1>
To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to obtain some <font color=LEVEL>cellular tissues of the Kaneus</font>.Will you help me?<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>(You may only undertake this quest only if you are eligible to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss, level 23 and 26.)</font><br1>
