Ah, so a Deluxe Fairy Stone will break when it comes in contact with blood? This stone is more fragile than I thought. You knew about this weakness before you fought? If Byron told you not to engage in combat, you should have followed his instructions... How unfortunate! Oh well, some people never learn. I'm just wasting my breath. Aren't you ready to give up and create a regular Fairy Stone? It's easier to make and more durable. What do you think?<br1>
