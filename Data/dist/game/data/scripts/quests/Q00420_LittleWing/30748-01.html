Greetings, two-legged creature! What brings you up this tall mountain? If you intend to kill me with that weapon, please proceed. Those vicious <font color=LEVEL>Leto Lizardmen</font> have stolen my eggs. I have already killed countless lizardmen trying to retrieve them but so far my search has been in vain. The depth of my grief precludes me from killing any more of those horrible creatures. If you truly believe in the sense of justice spoken of by your gods, please help me. You must find the eggs holding my sleeping babies! If you retrieve all of the eggs that were stolen, I shall give you one of them. This should demonstrate my sincerity and profound sense of loss. Will you help me?<br1>
