Hmm... A Fairy Stone, eh?<br1>
It shouldn't be very difficult to make... Let's see what ingredients you have brought... Coal, Charcoal... gemstones... silver and Toad Lord Back Skins... It's all here! If you will wait a moment. I'll make it now.<br1>
Gemstone with base.. Polish with silver. Umm, from this angle it seems very similar to a Crystal of Purity.<br1>
