<html><body>Wyvern Suzet:<br1>
I am a cold-hearted beast. Is this the Juice of Monkshood? I suppose Fairy Mimyu told you that in order to straighten out a dull-witted wyvern, you would have to pour this poison into my mouth? Poppycock! You should throw away such dangerous stuff.<br1>
If you have been sent by Mimyu, I suppose you are the one who will find my lost eggs. I guess you want a reward for your work, right? What is your wish? I will try to meet your expectations as much as possible.<br1>
