<html><body>Elder Cronos:<br1>
Such a stubborn youth! Do you only hear the words you want to hear? Fairies have been gone for centuries! In ancient times they became so disgusted with Human behavior they all flew away to another world! If you must see them, you might try looking in <font color=LEVEL>Enchanted Valley</font>. You must be very careful, that place is very dangerous. If someone enters the valley off guard, they can wind up dead before they know what happened!<br1>
