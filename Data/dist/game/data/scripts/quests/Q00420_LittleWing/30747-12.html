Let's get started!<br1>
OK.... It's moving. You're doing a good job...<br1>
All right! There is the weak spot. Here you go... One, two, three..! Once more... One! Two! Three!<br1>
Ah ha! A crack...<br1>
Alright, now come out under your own power! Here is your mother, little one... She will feed you and teach you many things!<br1>
OK, come on, let's go! A little more!<br1>
OK... Good job...! Thank you!<br1>
OK... I'll take a look... Perhaps it's due to the fact that it wasn't nurtured by its mother, but this hatchling looks a bit scrawny.<br1>
Do you still have the Fairy Dust that I gave you? Could you give me some of that? I've got an idea...<br1>
