You've really done it! This is Mimir's Elixir, the ultimate reagent! How is it used? It's very simple - you just swallow it! The only reason I told you to come back and see me is because I'm curious about the elixir's effects.<br1>
But before you drink it... While you were at the Watcher's Tomb, the man in dark armor came back. He asked me to give this letter to you. I just took a quick look... It contains characters from the ancient Ferios language. I can count on one hand all the people on this continent who can read it. I am one of them... If you wish, I will read the letter for you. <br1>
