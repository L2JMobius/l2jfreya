Did you finish your conversation?<br1>
Well, since I received this crystal in exchange for helping you, this has been a good day.<br1>
Ah, no worries, friend -- I am on your side, after all! I have no intention of turning you over to your enemies...<br1>
And now, I believe you must be going. You must find the <font color=LEVEL>man hiding in the Valley of Saints</font>. Why not head in that direction for now?
