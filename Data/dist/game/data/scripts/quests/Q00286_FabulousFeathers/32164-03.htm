When you enter Nornil's Cave, you will encounter bird-like humanoid creatures called Muertos. Among them are <font color=LEVEL>Captains, Warriors, Archers, Leaders and Wizards</font>, all of which can be distinguished by their powerful wings.<br1>
Some Humans will pay a premium for Muertos feathers to use as decorations for accessories and weapons.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Collect at least 80 feathers</font> and bring them to me.
