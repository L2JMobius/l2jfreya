<html><body>Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:<br1>
Billy Haari. He is the most despicable and loathsome being in existance.<br1>
Extortion, treason, fraud. You name it and he is guilty of it. The village I came from was just a stepping stone for Haari. By the time he disappeared, there wasn't one life in the town he hadn't damaged.<br1>
It was said that he sought refuge here in the Stakato's Nest. And although I've done much searching, I still don't know whether he is dead or alive. What I do know is that, the more monsters you kill, the easier it will be for me to get back in their and search for that criminal.<br1>
