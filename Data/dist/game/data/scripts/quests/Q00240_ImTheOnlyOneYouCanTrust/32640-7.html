<html><body>Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:<br1>
As you can see, I'm a bounty hunter. And generally, I do what I do for the money. But this one is personal to me.<br1>
I'm here to bring in Billy Haari for his crimes.<br1>And I almost had him... until he ran into the Stakato's Nest. I'm good at what I do. But this place is a bit too much for even me.<br1>
