I'm afraid I can't tell you much about that Medium Jar, not that you are the first to inquire about it... Some fellow from the Dark Elven village was asking questions about it a while back.<br1>
I'm of the opinion that the urn's abilities have been vastly over-stated in these wild rumors. I don't believe that actual souls of the dead can be conjured with it. At most it is a simple conduit between this world and the abyss where Shilen dwells. Hmm, that isn't far from the rumors, is it? Heh heh...<br1>
Oh, yes, I forgot. Some powder was delivered here recently that is supposed to be used with the urn. Something about putting it into the urn along with an article belonging to a dead person...<br1>
