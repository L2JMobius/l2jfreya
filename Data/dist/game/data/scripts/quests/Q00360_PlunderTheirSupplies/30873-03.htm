Captain Kurtiz says that in order to wipe them out completely, the <font color=LEVEL>Taik Orc seeker and the Taik Orc supply leader</font> must be stopped from giving supplies to the monsters.<br1>
But alas, our guards are having a hard time dealing with their forces. The captain has ordered me to find someone who can kill them for us.<br1>
You seem capable of doing it. Are you willing to help us? We will pay you a generous reward.<br1>
