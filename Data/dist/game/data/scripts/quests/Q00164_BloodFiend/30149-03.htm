Among the many battles with the Dark Elves, the fiercest battle took place in the Underground Fortress. The last battle between the two races happened there. The blood of the injured from both sides ran red on the floor of the fortress, and crows covered the skies. Suddenly, the gates of hell opened and the <font color=LEVEL>Drevanuls</font>, devils from hell, spilled forth. The Dark Elven Mystics, driven into a corner, had called upon these bloodthirsty devils.<br1>
Hundreds of Elves and Dark Elves alike were cruelly slain in the Underground Fortress in a bloody, evil feast of insanity. Luckily I survived, but I still suffer from nightmares.<br1>
Can't you see that we must avenge the deaths of our brothers who fought to protect our home from the dark race, and died at the cruel hands of those devils? I have already retired and cannot go forth with a sword or staff ... But shouldn't a young, brave youth like yourself honor the sacrifice of yr ancestors and avenge their deaths?<br1>
