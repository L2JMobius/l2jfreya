<html><body>Seer Reva:<br1>
Behold... countless ghosts encircle the Tower of Insolence! Just listen to their horrible screams! Do you feel their incredible rage?<br1>
The sword of a devil shall pierce the heart of an angel, and the bright red blood of the last emperor will run through the streets! Dawn and dusk will become as one, and the heavens and earth will tremble! This is how Pa'agrio describes the beginning of endless winter...<br1>
The arrogant humans are hastening their grisly fate! Unless the wrathful souls of the dead can be appeased, a terrible apocalypse will surely destroy this land forever!<br1>
I beg of you! Will you take the risk of the tower and help us?<br1>
