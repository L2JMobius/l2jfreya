Thank you! You are so generous!<br1>
There are Maille Lizardmen around here. They always try to steal the things going out from this town.<br1>
Wouldn't you be upset if your generosity, the Work Hammer, could not reach Talking Island because it was stolen by thieves?<br1>
So, please take the Maille Lizardmen down. I would be grateful if you could take out the <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardman Guards, Maille Lizardman Scouts, and Maille Lizardmen</font>. Defeat 30 of them.
