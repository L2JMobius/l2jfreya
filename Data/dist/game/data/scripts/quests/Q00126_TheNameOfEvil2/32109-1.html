<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br1>
I am the seal stone, the gatekeeper set to watch over Sailren.<br1>
I am also an avatar of Shilen, who was the mother of this island and the first daughter of Einhasad and Gran Kain.<br1>
I ask you, you who are imbued with the spirit of an Elrokian warrior, who you are and why you are here.<br1>
