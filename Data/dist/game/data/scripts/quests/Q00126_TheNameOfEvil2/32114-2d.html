I read this document over and over again, but I never thought the password was hidden inside.<br1>
I didn't know that this book was really a secret document written in ancient secret passwords -- like others, I read it only with scholarly interest.<br1>
But although this seems to be like any other document, through proper decryption we can discover its hidden meaning.<br1>
Legend has it that our ancestors once shared their secret documents in this way, but I've never seen such a thing before.<br1>
