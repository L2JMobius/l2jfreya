<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br1>
I have allowed the ancient Elrokian warrior's spirit to enter your body. Now you are a master of Gazkh! As long as the Elrokian spirit is within you, the Gazkh will serve you.<br1>
Remember, your loyalty is now to Shilen and Shilen alone!<br1>
In her stead, I command you, faithful warrior, to return to the Elrokian village and find the help you require to restore Gazkh.
