Well done. I must gather our Old Bronze Swords and send them to Blacksmith Karrod. They will be used to make useful items, such as armor or shields.<br1>
Our motto is to reward even the most minuscule of tasks. Please accept this as payment for your work on behalf of my sisters and me.<br1>
May the blessings of Shilen be with you until we meet again.
