It's done! Now, it must marinate in the ritron sauce. When it's hardened you can eat it. I call it "Rollant's Special Ritron Jelly".<br1>
Can you taste the hint of moon flower? I added the ritron fruit to the ritron sauce which really intensifies the flavor.<br1>
It melts in your mouth but still has a lovely texture, doesn't it?<br1>
Regretfully, this ritron fruit had been gnawed by wolves. I'm sure the taste won't be affected, but much of the joy of a dessert is its appearance...<br1>
Oh, well, you have to make do with what you have. Thank you for your work.
