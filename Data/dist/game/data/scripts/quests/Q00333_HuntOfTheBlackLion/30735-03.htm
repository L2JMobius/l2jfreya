Dear brother of the Black Lion, we must drive the evil spirits from this area.  Most of our troops have been dispatched to Gludio and we are only managing to hold the demons at bay.<br1>
Fortunately, Captain Leopold of Gludin has sent many reinforcements, and we can finally launch a serious attack on the stronghold of the evil spirits. Please join us in this fight!<br1>
