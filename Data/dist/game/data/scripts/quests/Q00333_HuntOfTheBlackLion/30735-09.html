<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br1>
We must rid the Cruma Marshlands of the evil stakato. The insect-like stakato is covered with tight scales and is equipped with two sharp forward claws. They are surprisingly quick. You must never underestimate them.<br1>
To make matters worse, the marshlands are inhabited by giant leeches, spiders and evil spirits haunting the Tower of Giants. Needless to say, this place is quite treacherous, especially when trying to carry out military operations.<br1>
