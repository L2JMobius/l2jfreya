Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br1>
A broken tablet fragment?  Hmm... What are these symbols?  Could  this be a relic from ancient times?  If this were a complete tablet, it would be a very valuable historical object.  You should find all the fragments of the tablet and take them to <font color=LEVEL>Blacksmith Rupio</font>.  He specializes in the restoration of relics.<br1>
