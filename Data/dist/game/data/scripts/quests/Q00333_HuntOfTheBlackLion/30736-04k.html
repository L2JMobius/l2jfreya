Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br1>
Ah, a silk dress, and a very expensive one by the looks of it! Notice the design.  This was imported from Avella of the east.  Who would order such an expensive item at a time like this?  This should fetch a high price at a store.<br1>
