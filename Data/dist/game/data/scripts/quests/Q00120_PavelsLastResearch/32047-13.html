All I know is that Dr. Chaos operated some kind of device.<br1>
According to my memory, the device was meant<font color=LEVEL> to control the weather</font> around Pavel.<br1>
When the sleeping system awoke, its first act was to activate this device.<br1>
I think perhaps the last mode in which it operated was <font color=LEVEL>N-45: Arrival of Eternal Spring.</font><br1>
