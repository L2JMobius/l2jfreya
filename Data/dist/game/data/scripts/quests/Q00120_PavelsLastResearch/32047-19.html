The east wing? Oh, yes. You are probably are talking about the place where I was born.<br1>
Dr. Chaos had his offices in the east wing. The last guardian was also resurrected there.<br1>
My memory of that time is not clear, but Dr. Chaos' records are still on the bookshelf next to his lab. The record in question is a book with a lock on it. I cannot open it, but the Dwarves in the north may know how.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Please be careful. There might be a trap on the shelf.</font>
