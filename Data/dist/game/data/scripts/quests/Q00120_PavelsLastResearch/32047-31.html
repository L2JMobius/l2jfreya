Listen closely, for this pertains to Dr. Chaos. <font color=LEVEL>From time to time, he comes here.</font><br1>
<font color=LEVEL>If you attempt to speak with him, though, he will treat you as an enemy and dispatch a Gigantic Chaos Golem to rend the flesh from your bones.</font><br1>
If you can defeat him here, it will certainly keep him from causing any trouble for a while.<br1>
As Atlanta said, it should not be a difficult task... provided that excellent adventurers such as yourselves are able to work together.<br1>
