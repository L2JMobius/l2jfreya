Oh, really?<br1>
Come closer, so no one will hear us...<br1>
...Some peasants actually survived that brutal repression!<br1>
They've established an autonomous community called Floran Village. There they have been leading free lives, or at least as free as peasants' hard lives can be, that is...<br1>
I'm so proud of them!<br1>
Still, I'm afraid things aren't going so well in Floran Village right now. But they have their pride, and hesitate to ask for the help they need from adventurers like you.<br1>
Oh, did I mention that I'm from Floran Village? I'm here on business for my village, as a matter of fact.<br1>
Would you help my village?<br1>
