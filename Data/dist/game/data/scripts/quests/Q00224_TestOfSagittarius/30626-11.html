Brankel lives! I met with him shortly before he left for the south of Oren.<font color=LEVEL> Commander Kadesh</font> is currently surviving off the flesh of Leto Lizardmen.<br1>
Dammit!  I should've gone with Brankel!<br1>
Oh! Look! The crescent arrow! I haven't seen it in 20 years!  Take it and follow Brankel! Kill the <font color=LEVEL>Leto Lizardmen</font> and Kadesh will appear! Kill him with the crescent arrow!<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>You mustn't use any other method or skill, or the power of the arrow will disappear and Kadesh will survive</font>!
