<html><body>Priest Cain:<br1>
While you were gone I did some research, by the by, and I believe the Contractor deaths have something to do with the <font color=LEVEL>Seven Signs</font>.<br1>
As I'm sure you know, the forces of dawn wage war with the forces of dusk for control over the three Seals. I may as well tell you now; I belong to the Order of the Dawn. That's actually how I came to be in charge of this place.<br1>
You've had first-hand experiences of these murders, as well as the murderers, and I feel I would be remiss in not extending our hand to you. Help us, and we will reward you well.<br1>
