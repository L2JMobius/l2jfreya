Pick it? No no--I have a supplier already, only he's a forgetful type and I fear he's just forgotten to send me the package.<br1>
I need you to visit my supplier, <font color=LEVEL>Herb Collector Eric</font>, and bring me the herbs that he should have already gathered. He's normally found in the <font color=LEVEL>Enchanted Valley</font>, so I'd suggest you start your search for him there.<br1>
Godspeed my friend. Be safe.
