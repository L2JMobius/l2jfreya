Long time no see! I knew you'd come. Thank you. I would have been killed by the assassin if it weren't for you. Do you remember my project? I succeeded in developing the time machine! It's called Wilma #3. Unfortunately, I can't show it to you now, it's broken.<br1>
 The pilgrimage of tablets? Ah, yes! You still haven't done the pilgrimage. I forgot that you'd returned to the future...<br1>
Hey! I'm really glad to see you! The pilgrimage! Sure, I'll help you!<br1>
