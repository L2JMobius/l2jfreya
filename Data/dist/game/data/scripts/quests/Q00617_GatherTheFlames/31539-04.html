<html><body>Vulcan, Blacksmith of the Flame:<br1>
Oh! You brought 1000 flames! What do you think? Do you want to trade the 1000 flames for my Weapon Recipe: Grade S?<br1>
I just remembered that my younger brother, <font color=LEVEL>Rooney</font>, also collects Flames in the Forge of the Gods. He's a wanderer, that boy! I've heard that <font color=LEVEL>he gives a Weapon Recipe: Grade S to anyone who brings him 1200 Flames</font>, but he probably won't be easy to find!<br1>
