<html><body>[Orc Fighter Class Transfer]:<br1>
When an Orc Fighter reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. Upon successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: Orc Raider or Monk. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, powerful and specialized. <br1>
In order to become an <font color=LEVEL>Orc Raider</font>, you must meet with <font color=LEVEL>Prefect Karukia</font>. <br1>
In order to become a <font color=LEVEL>Monk</font>, you must meet with <font color=LEVEL>Gantaki Zu Urutu</font>. <br1>
Both are in the <font color=LEVEL>Orc Village</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br1>
