From now on, you will receive the benefits of being a <font color=LEVEL>New Character</font>. <br1>Until you reach level 25, you will receive the following advantages:<br1>
1. Equipment exchange:<br1>
You can trade your current weapon or armor for higher quality equipment, paying only the difference in price. In order to initiate the trade, start a conversation with any merchant at a weapons or armor shop.<br1>
2. Support magic:<br1>You may ask a Newbie Guide to cast Support Magic on you, which can be very helpful when fighting monsters. You may receive Support Magic between levels 8 and 39.<br1>
3. You can also receive additional Soulshots and Spiritshots specially designed for beginners.<br1>
Each time you complete a particular quest as a newbie, you will also receive an additional reward. Now go to the Dark Elf Village and meet with <font color=LEVEL>Sentry Kristin</font>. She will give you the details of a quest to defeat Imps and Imp Elders in the Dark Elven Forest.<br1>
If you complete this quest, you will receive additional <font color=LEVEL>Soulshots or Spiritshots that are meant for beginners</font>.<br1>
