After reaching level 35 a character can undertake a quest to obtain a hatchling. Just like its master, a hatchling will mature with experience. Once it reaches a certain level it may be transformed into a strider or a wyvern and become a suitable mode of transportation.<br1>
There are three types of hatchling: hatchling of the wind, hatchling of the stars, and hatchling of twilight. Each has unique characteristics. This quest begins by meeting with <font color=LEVEL>Pet Manager Cooper of Giran Castle Town</font>.<br1>
