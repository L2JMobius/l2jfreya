From now on, you will receive the benefits of being a <font color=LEVEL>New Character</font>. <br1>
Until you reach level 25, you will receive the following advantages:<br1>
1. Equipment exchange:<br1>
You can trade your current weapon or armor for higher quality equipment, paying only the difference in price. In order to initiate the trade, start a conversation with any merchant at a weapons or armor shop.<br1>
2. Support magic:<br1>
You may ask a Newbie Guide to cast Support Magic on you, which can be very helpful when fighting monsters. You may receive Support Magic between levels 8 and 39.<br1>

Each time you complete a particular quest as a newbie, you will also receive an additional reward. Now, go to <font color=LEVEL>Zerstorer Marcela</font> at the south entrance of Kamael Village.  He will give you the details of a quest to defeat and gather the claws of <font color=LEVEL>Green Goblins, Hill Werewolves, Muertos Archers, Mountain Werewolf Chieftains, and Muertos Guards</font> at the Hills of Gold. <br1>
