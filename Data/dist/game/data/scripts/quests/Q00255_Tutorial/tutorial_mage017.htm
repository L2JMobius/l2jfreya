Congratulations! You have finally reached level 7.<br1>
Now you can learn new magic as well as strengthen your existing magic. To do so, please visit the <font color=LEVEL>Magister in the village.</font> If you follow the arrow above your head, you will be able to find the Magister.<br1>
However, to learn new magic, you must first purchase a <font color=LEVEL>spellbook</font>. Spellbooks can be purchased from the <font color=LEVEL>Magic Supply Store.</font> The Magister will tell you which spellbook you should purchase.<br1>
In order to learn a skill, a certain number of <font color=LEVEL>Skill Points (SP)</font> is required. Your SP will increase gradually every time you kill a monster, so if you run out of SP while learning skills, you can always earn more by hunting monsters.<br1>
To check your current SP amount, open the <font color=LEVEL>Character Info Window</font> by clicking on the <font color="FF0000">"face-shaped icon</font> on the bottom right screen or pressing ALT+T.<br1>
