What is it, my child?  Have you no fear of fire?<br1>
...Ah, you seek the Note of Fire... I see...<br1>
Of course I have it, silly!  Nothing comes for free, however...<br1>
If you will journey north, near the Ivory Tower, and retrieve 5 Flame Crystals from the Ghost Fires, I shall take them in exchange for the Note of Fire!  But not one less than 5!
