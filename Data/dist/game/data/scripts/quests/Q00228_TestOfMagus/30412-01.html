<html><body>Wind Sylph:<br1>
Nice to meet you, Elder of the magical world, manager of the elements. I am the Wind Sylph, messenger of Zephyr, guide of the storms. Have you come to me seeking the Tone of Wind, by any chance?<br1>
The wind is an elusive  figure, hard to grasp... Do you believe that you can get a note consisting of this wind? Only I can give the Tone of Wind.  You must make a deal with me.<br1>
