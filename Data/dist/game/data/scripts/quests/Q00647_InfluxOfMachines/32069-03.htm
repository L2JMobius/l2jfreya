<html><body>Collector Gutenhagen:<br1>
The job is to take care of these Golems.<br1>
Yumi's been doing it alone, but she needs help, someone she can rely on.<br1>
Any Golems belonging to the Horrifying Golem Army are fine.<br1>
You will be dealing with Guard Golems inside the building or Jackhammer Golems in the Strip Mines. When you collect <font color=LEVEL>500 fragments</font> from them I'll trade you for some items out of the Collector Guild.<br1>
Good luck golem smasher!
