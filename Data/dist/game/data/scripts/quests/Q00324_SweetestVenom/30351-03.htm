Have you ever tried <font color=LEVEL>Dreviant Wine</font>? It's the sweetest, but most dangerous wine that those of my race enjoy drinking. The wine is made from the distilled poison of spiders, you see. Only a few people in the entire continent, including myself, know how to make this wine. I had the opportunity to learn this skill before Hierarch Mitraell was entrapped by that seal. Rumor has it that the Drevanul whispered into the Hierarch's ear how to make this precious wine.<br1>
Perhaps it is because the secret has been passed down from the Drevanuls, but when our brothers who practice the dark arts drink this wine, their understanding of magic is heightened momentarily. Since I am not well versed in magic, I do not know if this is true or not.<br1>
A few days ago Trader Vollodos received a shipment of grapes cultivated in the Human land of Gludio, and I am thinking of purchasing them to make a few bottles of Dreviant Wine. The most difficult ingredient to find is the <font color=LEVEL>spider's poison</font>, and I would like you to take care of that for me. Can you help me?<br1>
