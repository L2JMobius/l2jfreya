Finally, Shilen's followers used the dark ceremony they had originally intended for Aden on Gracia. They opened a door to the land of death: the Seed. Horrific monsters entered the land, further devastating it and its people.<br1>
Now we must all unite against this threat. That's why need adventurers willing and able to take this battle to the shores of Gracia.<br1>
If we fail, that evil will soon find its way here... We desperately need your help!<br1>
