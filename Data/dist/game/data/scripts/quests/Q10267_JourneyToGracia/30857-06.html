<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br1>
I appreciate your commitment. All of Aden will be counting on you and your comrades.<br1>
Your first challenge will be reaching Gracia. First, go to the <font color=LEVEL>Aden Airship Dock</font>. There you should ask the manager, <font color=LEVEL>Magister Papiku</font>, about the details of the journey.<br1>
Take this. It is a letter to <font color=LEVEL>Keucereus</font>, who currently rules Gracia. It designates you as one of the Aden warriors sent to fight the evil in his land. I pray you will be able to help him...and us. May Einhasad shine her blessed light upon your path...
