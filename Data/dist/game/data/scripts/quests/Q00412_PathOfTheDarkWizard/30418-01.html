The finest Wizards of the Dark Elven race used to study black magic here a long time ago. But this place has since been abandoned and is now in ruins. Can't you feel the spirit of evil inside? The accumulated dark magic is so strong, even a Fighter like myself can feel its power.<br1>
I am training to become a sentry. The training course involves exploring the School of Dark Arts here. However, whenever I go into dark and closed spaces, I cannot breathe. Just the thought of going into that place steals my breath. I beg you... Please help me complete my training.<br1>
