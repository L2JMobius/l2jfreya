<html><body>Dark Knight Mordred:<br1>
Haven't you heard? For a Dark Avenger to become a Hell Knight, he must leave the Human realm and enter the Realm of the Gods! Basically, he must receive the power that was forbidden by the gods. This power was sealed by the gods and scattered throughout the world, to keep the Humans from gaining their full potential.<br1>
The Tablets of Vision are the keepers of this power. When you absorb the information from all six Tablets of Vision, you'll gain a power that's far superior to any that anyone has ever possessed! Such is the path of the Hell Knight.<br1>
Waldstein's been spotted lurking near the Tablets of Vision. Find him and see if it's true that he's joined the Death Lords.<br1>
