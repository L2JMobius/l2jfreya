Unless you present proof that you have killed the lizardmen I will be unable to compensate you. This has nothing to with trust. I believe what you say, I just must have the fangs. I have turned away others who lacked proof. If I were to give you special treatment there would be reprisals against me. Do you understand? Go and get the <font color=LEVEL>lizardmen fangs</font>.<br1>
