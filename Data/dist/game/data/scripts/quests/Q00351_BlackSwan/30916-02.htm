Duke Iason Heine refused the Lord's offer, saying that it was a private matter and he would deal with it. This would be a good time to compliment the Duke on his concern for the public treasury, but, alas, I know him too well.<br1>
Anyway, I'm recruiting volunteers to drive away the Tasaba lizardmen for the Duke. He will personally give out the rewards when we are successful. If you wish to volunteer, speak up now!<br1>
