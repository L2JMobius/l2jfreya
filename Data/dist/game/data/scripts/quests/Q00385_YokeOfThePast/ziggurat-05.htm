<html><body>Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br1>
Good choice! Now go to the dungeon, slay <font color=LEVEL>the guardians of ancient cult</font> and bring back the <font color=LEVEL>scrolls of ancient magic</font>.<br1>
When you bring me the scroll, I will remove the magic power it contains and turn the scroll into a <font color=LEVEL>Blank Scroll</font>. A Blank Scroll is the only reward I can offer you.<br1>
Have you heard of <font color=LEVEL>Merchant of Mammon</font> who often appears in the castle area? He will be very interested in a Blank Scroll. You will find out more when you meet him. It won't be easy to find him though...<br1>
