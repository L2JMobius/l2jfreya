<html><body>Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br1>
The Guardians are <font color=LEVEL>the undead and demons </font> summoned by the wicked shamans who serve the goddess of death. These creatures are bound here, to protect this sepulchre from the Cross Army of Light.<br1>
They call themselves <font color=LEVEL>Lookout, Watcher, Guard, Monk, Overlord, Shaman, Consul, Inquisitor, Guardian, Elder, Court Guard and Preacher.</font><br1>
But you must not harm Nephilim, Lilim, Gigant and Lilith. They are soldiers of the gods, most holy warriors, and you dare not raise your sword against them.
