<html><body>Captain Bezique:<br1>
So we meet again. Are you still on your quest? Ho ho, it must not be that easy to become a Human Knight.<br1>
Have you been to Talking Island? As you know, the island is also a part of the Gludio province. The captain of guards and the high priest there also have coins of the lords. As it is a remote place, security will be loose, and a warrior -- no, an apprentice Knight -- like yourself will be of aid.<br1>
Go to the wharf of the harbor to take a ship going to Talking Island If you don't know the way to the harbor, ask Guard Plink.
