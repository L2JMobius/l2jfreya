From your mark I gather that you are undergoing the Trial of the Esquire. They must be hard up for students, eh? Your courage is admirable but, honestly my friend, you may as well give up. Do you think just anyone can become a Knight?<br1>
You are not even of noble birth, are you?  One cannot become a true Knight without noble birth and natural talent.  It is really pathetic to see someone from the lower classes struggle to become a Knight.
