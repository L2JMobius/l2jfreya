I have seen many young people like you who seek to become Human Knights. They foolishly try to act the part of the hero, and put not only themselves, but others in danger with their foolishness.<br1>
This age no longer needs noble heroes. No one expects a courageous knight to appear and save them. Do you know what the people want? They want well-organized guards, carrying good weapons that will protect them, and a strong castle wall outside the village.<br1>
