Hmmmm....? A hammer? Let me see...<br1>
What? This is really old! I haven't seen this kind of hammer in a long time!<br1>
So, this pillar, I'm sure you know, stands for our Gray Pillar Guild. And the star that is connected to this column, you see the two lines between them?<br1> These lines symbolize the railroad. Basically, it means, <font color=LEVEL>the railroad that reaches the stars and the Sky Wagon that runs on it. They actually had plans for one back then!</font><br1>
