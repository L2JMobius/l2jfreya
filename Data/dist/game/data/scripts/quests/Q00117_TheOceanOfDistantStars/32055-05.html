Ghost of the Anciant Railroad Engineer:<br1>
Oh, woe! I can't hold it! I can't hold it!<br1>
I thought I could hold at least this hammer if nothing else! My own good hammer, and I have no hand to hold it...<br1>

One last favor, living ones â€” could you <font color=LEVEL>please go to the Trolley Ruins and meet my friend for me?</font> I am too weak to go see him now.
