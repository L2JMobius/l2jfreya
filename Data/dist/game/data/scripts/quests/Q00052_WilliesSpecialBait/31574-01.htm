Hi, traveler! You look like an experienced fisherman! You know, if you want to catch something really special, you've got to use special bait!<br1>
I think you're ready for the big time, my friend! I suggest you try this bait made of Tarlk basilisk's eyes! It pulls the most incredible things from the deep! It's one of the most powerful of my products! It uses the power of the spirit of the land! Will you bring the materials I need to make it for you?<br1>
