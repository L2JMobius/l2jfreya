Please go to the <font color=LEVEL>Pagan Temple</font> and defeat the evil ones that inhabit it! After you've destroyed them, bring me their <font color=LEVEL>Pagan Totems</font>. You'll be well-rewarded if you bring more that <font color=LEVEL>2000</font> of them! Of course, our definitions of large rewards might differ...<br1>
As you must have guessed, the Pagan Temple is heavily defended and will not easily overtaken. <font color=LEVEL>Priest Eliyah could give you guidance on how to penetrate their defence</font>.<br1>
