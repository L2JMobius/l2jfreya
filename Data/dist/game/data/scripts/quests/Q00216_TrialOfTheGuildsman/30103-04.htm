Dwarven apprentices will work in the Strip Mine to strengthen their bodies and spirits, as well as learning to protect their own bodies. When they complete basic training they return to the Dwarven Village and accumulate experience while assisting the Elders of the guilds with chores.<br1>
After they pass the exam given by the guild, and are awarded the title of Scavenger or Artisan, they are no longer considered apprentices. But even that is not enough to become an official guild member. Only when they pass the <font color=LEVEL>Trial of the Guildsman</font> will they be accepted as a true guild member.<br1>
This test is essential if you intend to learn the techniques of a high-level guild member and aspire to the profession of Bounty Hunter or Warsmith.<br1>
