All right. I accept your apology. But only this once. So listen carefully to my words.<br1>
Rumor has it that the thieves are very nimble. If you want to deal with them, you must increase your agility to their level. That is probably why Bezique said that he would acknowledge you as a Rogue if you catch those thieves. Great agility is the main talent you must have to be a Rogue.<br1>
Before you handle those thieves, I must test you to fathom your agility. If you pass this test, you will be able to catch the thieves easily.<br1>
