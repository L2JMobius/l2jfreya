Why are you still here? Hurry along -- kill the Cat's Eye Bandits and recover the four stolen items. Remember that you must use The Bow and dagger that Neti gave you to kill those scoundrels.<br1>
According to my men, the thieves are near the abandoned campgrounds. If you don't know how to get there, ask Guard Praga.
