If you are interested in the match, simply <font color=LEVEL>register for battle</font>. <font color=LEVEL>When you are ready to start, have the leader of your party let me know.</font><br1>
After the party leader selects one of the following <font color=LEVEL>degrees of battle difficulty</font>, entry will be granted:<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>2-3</font> for battle with <font color=LEVEL>Mounted Troop Chamberlains</font>,<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>4-5</font> for battle with <font color=LEVEL>Mounted Troop Soldiers</font>,<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>6-7</font> for <font color=LEVEL>Mounted Troop Warriors</font>, and <br1>
<font color=LEVEL>8-9</font> for <font color=LEVEL>Mounted Troop Great Warriors</font>.<br1>
These are only recommendations; choose whichever level you want. But you're responsible for the consequences of your selection...<br1>
