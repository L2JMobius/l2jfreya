It is a scroll called the "Scroll of Escape: Town of Giran". Use it to safely transport yourself to Town of Giran. But use it wisely -- it will disappear after just one use!<br1>
Ah! Here is a Mark of Traveler that Zenya prepared for you. When you decide to return to the Isle of Souls, take this to Trader Galladucci at the luxury goods store in the Town of Giran. He will help you then.<br1>
May your journey be filled with adventure!
