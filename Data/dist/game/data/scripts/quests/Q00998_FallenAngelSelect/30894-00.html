Both of these missions are very important.<br1>
Not only must they be completed quickly, they also have extensive political ramifications.<br1>

(Only characters level 38 and above who have completed Shadow Fox - 3 are permitted to undertake either the Fallen Angel - Request of Dusk or the Fallen Angel - Request of Dawn quest.)
