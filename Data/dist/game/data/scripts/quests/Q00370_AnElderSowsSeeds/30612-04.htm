In order to obtain the pieces of the spellbook, you must conquer the <font color=LEVEL>ant recruits, ant patrols, ant guards, the noble ant and the noble ant leader</font>.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Check carefully any scraps of paper you come across</font>. The pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" should be easy to identify.<br1>
The spellbook has four chapters: <font color=LEVEL>the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth</font>. The contents will only be discernible if you recover all four chapters.<br1>
This is a challenging task, but I think you are ready for it. May the divine blessing be with you...
