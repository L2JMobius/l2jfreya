Did you know that at one time this barren wasteland was one of the most fertile places in Aden? For centuries, farmers sowed their seeds and harvested their abundant crops here. Ah, yes, those were the days...<br1>
But then that devil Beleth and his minions arrived. We had to act quickly. We were compelled to at last open the forbidden spellbook...<br1>
For two days and nights fire rained down on us and dark magic swept over the land like a whirlwind... It wasn't at all what we'd anticipated...<br1>
When it was over, this is all that was left... A dusty wasteland inhabited by weird-looking freaks...<br1>
Some day, hopefully, we shall find a way to change this place back into the verdant farmland it once was... I hope we can count on you when that time comes.<br1>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 28 or above.)
