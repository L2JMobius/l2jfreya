Tejakar Oroka! Have you come back already?<br1>
I'm sorry but I am meditating, so I do not have any time to deal with you! Go hunt the <font color=LEVEL>kasha bladespider</font>. And bring back five blade-shaped talons in this pouch. Then I will especially put aside some time to teach you.<br1>
I tell you again, but if you use any other weapon besides your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons, you are disqualified! A true monk must be able to fight without depending on weapons!
