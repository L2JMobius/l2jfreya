<html><body>Khavatari Aren:<br1>
You have returned with the spider fangs, I perceive. How do I know? I saw your battle!<br1>
How did I see it, you ask? The power of Kabart, my young friend! Through it, I can watch you - just like my totem, the spider web of Duda-Mara.<br1>
You did very well. Now I will give you a more difficult job to test your worthiness.<br1>
There are creatures called <font color=LEVEL>Baar Dre Vanul, who live south of the Immortal Plateau</font>. If you defeat them and bring their horns to me, you will have proven your worth to be a monk.<br1>
And yes, once again, you must <font color=LEVEL>fight using only Kabart. If you depend on weapons instead of your own skill, the path to Kabart will remain closed to you.</font>
