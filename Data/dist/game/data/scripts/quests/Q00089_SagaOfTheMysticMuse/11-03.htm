You can get the next stone by killing<font color=LEVEL> the Archon of Halisha</font> in the Four Sepulchers. You'll need help to gain entry.<br1>
If that proves too difficult, go to the<font color=LEVEL> Shrine of the Loyal</font> and slay Halisha's minions. If you collect 700<font color=LEVEL> Halisha's Marks</font>, the Archon will appear.<br1>
The minions include<font color=LEVEL> Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights, and Shrine Guards</font>.</body></html>
