(Show the item to Ulu Kaimu).<br1>
Hmmm... This recalls memories of....<br1>
The blessing of water...my mother Shilen... I also remember Shilen's wisdom -- and her concern about the dinosaurs.<br1>
But I don't think my memories are the wisdom you seek.<br1>
Go to my other brother Kaimus and show them the item and receive their wisdom...<br1>
