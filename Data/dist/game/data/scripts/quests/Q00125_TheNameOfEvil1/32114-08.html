Very well. Then go to Karakawei and tell him that I sent you. He will tell you in detail what you must do in the Lost Nest.<br1>
Complete the task as Karakawei directs you and then return to me.<br1>
This is all I can tell you -- it is not entirely safe to speak openly of these important matters here.<br1>
Before you leave, take this. There will be a time when it proves useful to you, so please take good care of it.
