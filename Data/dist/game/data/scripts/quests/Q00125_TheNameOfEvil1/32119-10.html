<html><body>Ulu Kaimu:<br1>
I am Ulu Kaimu, a Pillar of Wisdom whose name means "eyes watching earth" in the Elrokian tongue. You used Shilen's word to awaken me!<br1>
Now you know how to communicate with me, so tell me: How is it that you came to know that word? If you have awakened me for some mundane thing, you will not survive your blasphemy...<br1>
