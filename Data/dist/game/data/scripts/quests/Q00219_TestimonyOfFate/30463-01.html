Belladonna? Of course I can make it for you. But first I need a few things.<br1>
I need <font color=LEVEL>Medusa's Blood, Marsh Spider Fluids, Dead Seeker Dung, Tyrant's Blood, and Nightshade Root</font>. Please bring <font color=LEVEL>10 of each</font>.<br1>
You will find the Dead Seeker bat at the Execution Grounds in Dion, Tyrant in the Wastelands of Gludio, and the Nightshade Root can be obtained from the stakatos of Cruma Marshlands. Here is a list. Once you have gathered all the materials, bring them back to me.
