Defeat the <font color=LEVEL>Cosmic Scout, Cosmic Watcher, Cosmic Priest, and Cosmic Lord</font>. You will pick up a <font color=LEVEL>fragment of their essence</font> after defeating them. Assemble these parts and you will have a Seal Breaker, a stone that will allow you to travel directly to Ranku and Demon Prince by fooling the Tower's Seal into thinking you a devil.<br1>
Bring the parts to me and I can convert them.<br1>
