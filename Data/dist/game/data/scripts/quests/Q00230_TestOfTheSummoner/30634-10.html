<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br1>
As I previously stated, in order to pass the Trials of the Summoner, you must <font color=LEVEL>battle and defeat six summoners</font>. Before you challenge an opponent, you must have your own unique <font color=LEVEL>Arcana Cards</font> created. Go and ask <font color=LEVEL>Lara of the town of Dion</font> about making cards.<br1>
Do you have any other questions?<br1>
