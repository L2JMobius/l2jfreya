<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br1>
This trial tests to see if you have the will and determination to become a Summoner. What must be done is quite simple. You must <font color=LEVEL>seek out and engage other Summoners in battle</font>. <font color=LEVEL>Achieve victory against six opponents</font> and you will prove yourself worthy and pass the test.<br1>
This may seem an easy task, but <font color=LEVEL>a battle amongst Summoners</font> is fairly difficult and will test a Summoner's ability to control his or her summoned creature.<br1>
