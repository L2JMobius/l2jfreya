<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br1>
In the old days Summoners created their own cards, but the cards have become so sophisticated that they must be created by a special craftsmen. Note that you are not yet an official Summoner and may only receive <font color=LEVEL>Apprentice Arcana Cards</font>. Perhaps the day will come when you may possess a Major Arcana Card, a card that is only held by the top Summoners of the land!<br1>
The card you will be making now is for use in the trial, so it need not be ostentatious. You must seek out a craftsman who knows the methods for creating arcana cards. <font color=LEVEL>Trader Lara in the Town of Dion</font> will probably make a card for you.<br1>
She works rather slowly, so I suggest that you order a good supply of them up front.<br1>
