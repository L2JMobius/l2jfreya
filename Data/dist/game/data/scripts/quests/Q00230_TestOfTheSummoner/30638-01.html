Greetings, traveler. I am Basillia, a Summoner of the Ivory Tower.<br1>
I was born in this place, but left it over 30 years ago.<br1>
Let's get down to business, shall we?  I know what you're here for...  Take out your Arcana Card and prepare for battle!   I have already summoned my cat, Mimi.<br1>
