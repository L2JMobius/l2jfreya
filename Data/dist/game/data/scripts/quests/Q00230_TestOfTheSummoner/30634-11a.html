<html><head><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br1>
The battles are waged between the summoned creatures alone. As an apprentice, you are automatically classified as the lower ranked Summoner and receive the advantage of the first attack.<br1>
During battle, the Summoner may assist his or her creature with magic, but cannot physically attack an opponent's creature.<br1>
A penalty is given if a Summoner physically attacks an opponent's creature or receives the aid of another.<br1>
The defeated Summoner must surrender his or her Arcana Card to the victor.<br1>
