Thank you for your help.<br1>
According to the information we acquired from you, to turn Freya back into her old self, we have to collect Ice Crystals that are spread all over this territory and which are grown within creatures' bodies.<br1>
They usually have a silver color, and that's why they're called Silver Ice Crystals. If you can bring these back to me, I will reward you for your work. And, I know it will be even more difficult to get Black Ice Crystals, but if you bring those back to me, I will reward you even more.<br1>
Oh, yes! And if you ever find any Silver Hemocytes, don't throw them away.<br1>
