It's dangerous outside, so please be careful! I'm telling you, most of the creatures living in the Frozen Labyrinth have a Silver Ice Crystal in their bodies. Bring me these crystals and you'll be well-rewarded. Black Ice Crystals are quite rare, but if you find one and bring it back to me, you'll be rewarded even more!<br1>
Oh, by the way... If you ever get any Silver Hemocytes, don't throw them away.<br1>
