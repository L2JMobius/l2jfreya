Thanks to your efforts, we were able to recreate the missing inspector's report.<br1>
Based on his findings, we have written a manifesto showing that the advent of the angel proves the authority and legitimacy of the Temple.<br1>
We wish to distribute this document to the groups who have broken ties with us.<br1>
If you give this to Preacher Sla, he will be able to disseminate it to those groups.<br1>
