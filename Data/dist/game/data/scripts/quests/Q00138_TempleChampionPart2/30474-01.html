(Angus looks very sad...)<br1>
Hmm...<br1>
You wish to help me?<br1>
Well then... One of the Dark Elven trainees was accidentally killed during an actual fighting drill in Death Pass.<br1>
I am preparing a ritual that will permit his soul to return to Shilen in peace.<br1>
I do this in accord with the customs of his people...<br1>
To perform the ritual, however, we will need his belongings, which were lost in Death Pass.<br1>
You belong to the Temple of Einhasad, do you not?<br1>
Are you sure that you wish to provide aid to a follower of Shilen?<br1>
