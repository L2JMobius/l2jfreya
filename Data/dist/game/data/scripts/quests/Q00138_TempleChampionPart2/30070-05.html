We have commissioned Shadow Fox, the information dealer, to gather information about the angel from his sources...<br1>
I dislike the secrecy associated with using an outsider like that, but I accept the need for it at this delicate juncture.<br1>
If you wish to help search for the angel, contact Shadow Fox.<br1>
He will not reveal himself directly, so you should <font color=LEVEL>ask Warehouse Keeper Mia in Heine how to contact Shadow Fox</font>...<br1>
She has already told him that an experienced adventurer would be an asset in the search.<br1>
Tell Warehouse Keeper Mia that I sent you and she should speed you on your way to Shadow Fox.<br1>
You have served us well in this matter. May Einhasad guard you on your journey!
