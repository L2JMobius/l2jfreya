Very well, I will tell you.<br1>
As you know, Kamael society is organized along military lines.<br1>
Certain necessary tasks must be conducted in secret for the good of our society.<br1>
We are the group entrusted to carry out those sensitive missions.<br1>
All our members are able to use Arbalester skills.<br1>
If you can find our secret group and pass the entrance test, you too can aspire to be an Arbalester...<br1>
