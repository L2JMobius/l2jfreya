<html><body>Magister Clayton:<br1>
Actually, I had asked a Dwarven Artisan to craft a certain tool I require for my magic experiment.<br1>
He sent back a list of ingredients that he needs to craft it.<br1>
Although I have managed to obtain most of the materials on his list,<br1>
I have had no luck procuring any Enmity Crystals.<br1>
Please go to <font color=LEVEL>Floran Village</font>, hunt the <font color=LEVEL>Watchman of the Plains</font>, the <font color=LEVEL>Roughly-Hewn Rock Golem</font>, the <font color=LEVEL>Delu Lizardman Supplier</font>, the <font color=LEVEL>Delu Lizardman Special Agent</font>, the <font color=LEVEL>Cursed Seer</font>, the <font color=LEVEL>Delu Lizardman Commander</font> and the <font color=LEVEL>Delu Lizardman Shaman</font>, and bring back <font color=LEVEL>30 Enmity Crystals</font>.
