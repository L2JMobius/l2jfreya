<html><body>Master Rindy:<br1>
Hey, there! I am Rindy, a chief officer of the Kamael Special Forces, Steelrazor. You're the one who captured Tak, aren't you?<br1>
Thanks to you, I have been able to gather a lot of useful information. Good work!<br1><br1>
Ah, I see that you're interested in becoming an Arbalester.<br1>
I hate to tell you this, but I don't think that you are quite experienced enough now to pursue that path.<br1>
Why don't you train some more and come back later...<br1>
