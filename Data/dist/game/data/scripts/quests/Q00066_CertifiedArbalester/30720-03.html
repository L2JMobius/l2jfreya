Ha!<br1>
Gauen had the gall to say such things!?<br1>
It is he who wished to keep the Giants' research documents.<br1>
His greed and duplicity are almost unbelievable...<br1>
He pretends to be an honorable man, but the real Gauen is a mystery.<br1>
I swear that what we did, we did to prevent the documents from falling into the hands of Beleth.<br1>
That was the perfect opportunity for Gauen to steal them himself and concoct this lame excuse.<br1>
If he really had nothing to hide, why would he involve Manashen? <br1>
