<html><body>Master Selsia:<br1>
Eliminate the Crimson Lady and retrieve the Giants' Research Documents.<br1>
We must not allow secrets concerning our race to fall into other hands.<br1>
The <font color=LEVEL>Crimson Lady is being guarded by Timak Orcs and Timak Orc Archers at the Timak Outpost</font>.<br1>
Slay the <font color=LEVEL>Timak Orcs and Timak Orc Archers</font> and you will no doubt find her.<br1>
This is not an easy task, but I believe in you...<br1>
Good luck to you!
