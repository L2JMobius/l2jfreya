<html><body>Master Rindy:<br1>
Hey, there! I am Rindy, a chief officer of the Kamael Special Forces, Steelrazor. You're the one who captured Tak, aren't you?<br1>
Thanks to you, I have been able to gather a lot of useful information. Good work!<br1>
Ah, I see that you're interested in becoming an Arbalester.<br1>
I heard that the qualification test is pretty difficult...<br1>
Still interested in pursuing that path?<br1>
