Sir Eric Rodemai:<br1>
Very well, go and kill the <font color=LEVEL>Last Lesser Giant Glaki</font> and bring me Glaki's Nucleus.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Remember, you don't have to kill the Last Lesser Giant Glaki yourself.</font> There's no rule that says a Clan Leader must get his hands bloody! <font color=LEVEL>Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Last Lesser Giant Glaki and then bring me back Glaki's Nucleus.</font><br1>
