Sir Eric Rodemai:<br1>
The townsfolk of Aden Castle live in mortal fear of the <font color=LEVEL>Raid Bosses</font> in this area. If they were to actually make it into the village... Naturally, we have guards posted, but there aren't any guarantees!<br1>
Please, use the power of your Clan to set the townsfolk free from fear! Help us and we'll raise your Clan's reputation by spreading the word far and wide of your good deed! Will you help us?<br1>
