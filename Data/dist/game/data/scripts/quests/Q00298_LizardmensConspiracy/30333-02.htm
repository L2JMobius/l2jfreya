<html><body>Guard Praga:<br1> 
As you may know, the <font color=LEVEL>Maille Lizardman stronghold</font> is in the west part of the Town of Gludio.<br1>
During the war with Gracia, they infiltrated our land through a gap in our security, and our guards have been unable to drive them out since. An interesting report about them has recently surfaced, and Magister Rohmer is investigating the matter.<br1>
He's hopeful that this new intelligence will allow us to destroy the Lizardman forces soon. He's looking for someone to help him with this mission.<br1>
(Only a character of level 25 or above may undertake this quest.)
