Many thanks.<br1>
The Langk Lizardman tribe used to keep to themselves on the southern shoreline, hunting and looting. Our scouts tell us that they've become organized and pose a serious threat!<br1>
Some of their warriors are said to possess incredible new powers!<br1>
We need your help clearing the southern shoreline road of Langk lizardmen. There are mainly <font color=LEVEL>Langk Lizardman sentinels</font> and <font color=LEVEL>Langk Lizardman lieutenants</font> threatening the roadway. Bring back 100 Feather Ornaments worn by Langk Lizardman Warriors as proof of your deed.<br1>
Keep on the lookout for anything suspicious that might explain their sudden aggression. Good luck!
