This movement's motto is "Education, Preservation, Dedication". If you have taken our pledge, then you must help us uphold these tenets. In order to return this place back to its former glory, we need to eradicate the Mucrokians. The lands between the Fields of Silence and the Field of Whispers is overrun with them. Please help us... before it is too late.<br1>
