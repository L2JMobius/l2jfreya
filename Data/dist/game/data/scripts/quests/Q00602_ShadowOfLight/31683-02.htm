<html><body>Eye of Argos:<br1>
Your courage may yet save the world!<br1>
Daimon the White-Eyed uses his underlings to transform monsters into slaves. Once they've been transformed, they're beyond redemption. Kill them so they can rest in peace.<br1>
You can get the eyes of darkness if you kill Buffalo Slaves and Grendel Slaves. When you get 100 eyes of darkness, visit me again.
