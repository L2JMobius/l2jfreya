<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
Ah, the Infernium Varnish! I wish that you hadn't told him so much... I just wanted you to get the Varnish, not gossip about my personal business!<br>Anyway, thanks for the Varnish. Things are going well. Yesterday, I received a letter from the president of the Black Anvil Guild! He says that he will pardon my sins and accept me as a guildsman. Yes, thanks to you, I've become a maestro again...<br>
Now I can set about making a weapon of the utmost quality for you! Unfortunately, I don't have the hammer I need to make it. If only I had my old hammer...<br>
