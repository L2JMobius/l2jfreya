Grand Magister Valdis:<br1>
The local townsfolk live in mortal fear of the <font color=LEVEL>Raid Bosses</font> in this area! It would be disastrous if they were to actually intrude into the village...<br1>
Would you and your friends please use your power to set the minds of our townsfolk at ease? Success would give an enormous boost to your Clan's prestige throughout the land! What do you think? Will you help us?<br1>
