<html><body>Guard Alvah:<br1>
Have you found proof of the alliance? What's this? Ol mahum's operation orders? Let me see that...<br1>
This is unbelievable...! The Ol Mahums' target is not Gludin Village after all! They intend to seize the Orc Barracks! Those deceitful beasts plan to falsely pledge an alliance with the orcs, send them off to train for the attack on Gludin Village and then seize their unguarded barracks! What treacherous creatures they are!<br1>
If the Ol Mahums are allowed to take the take the western part of Gludin Village and also establish a base in the north, we will be completely cut off!<br1>
