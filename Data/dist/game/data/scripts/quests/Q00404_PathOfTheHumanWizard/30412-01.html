<html><body>Wind Sylph:<br1>
I see you have come to find the Wind Token. The winds blowing here told me of your story. If you grant me one favor, I will happily give you the Wind Token.<br1>
Not long ago, <font color=LEVEL>the wastelands Lizardman</font> appeared in the Southern Wastelands, and it has been so noisy ever since that I haven't been able to savor the wind comfortably.<br1>
Please make the wastelands Lizardman quiet so my meditations are not disrupted. Then I will give you the Wind Token.<br1>
Since scary monsters are prowling around on the southern hills, it would be safer for you to follow the western path of the valley and then head south.
