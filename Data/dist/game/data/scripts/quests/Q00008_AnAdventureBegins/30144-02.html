Oh no! Jasmine and Roselyn must both bear the responsibility for their actions this time.<br1>
Last time I only blamed Jasmine, but it's become clear that they both need to be taught a lesson!<br1>
You have a stake in this as well, my friend. You should go to Jasmine and give her this message in person!<br1>
Tell her that she's upset the Tetrarch terribly, and to keep her mouth shut! Can you do that?<br1>
And, as punishment, she should grant one of your wishes.<br1>
May the divine blessing of the Mother of the Abyss be with you always!
