<html><body>Chief Ashas Varka Durai:<br1>
Have you heard of Hekaton, the hero of those despicable Ketra Orcs? Countless brave Varka soldiers have fallen before his axe, and I can still hear his howls of victory! We Varka can no longer ignore his atrocities! I seek a brave warrior to execute this scurvy dog! Will you prove your valor to all Varkas by cutting down Hekaton, the sworn enemy of the Varka?<br1>
