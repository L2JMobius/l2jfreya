If you win the game, the master running it owes you the appropriate amount. The higher the round, the bigger the payout. That's why the game only allows you to win up to 8 rounds in a row. If -- and that's a big if -- you manage to win 8 straight times, the game will end.<br1>
Keep in mind that <font color=LEVEL>if you lose any of the rounds, you get nothing.</font> That's fair warning, my friend. Here's how the prize system works:<br1>
1 winning round: 40,000 Adena<br1>
2 winning rounds: 80,000 Adena<br1>
3 winning rounds: 110,000 Adena, D-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll<br1>
4 winning rounds: 199,000 Adena, C-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll<br1>
5 winning rounds: 388,000 Adena, 1 recipe for a B-grade Weapon<br1>
6 winning rounds: 675,000 Adena, 1 essential ingredient for a B-grade Weapon<br1>
7 winning rounds: 1,284,000 Adena, 2 B-grade Enchant Weapon Scrolls, 2 B-grade Enchant Armor Scrolls<br1>
8 winning rounds: 2,384,000 Adena, 1 A-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll, 2 A-grade Enchant Armor Scrolls<br1>
My advice is to identify what you'd like to win and then to play for that prize. Any questions?<br1>
