Ah! Yeah, the thing that you guys have to do is bring me energy stones. The degenerated Soul warriors that are living there are curious creatures. However, folks such as yourselves can still find a way to deal with them.<br1>
If you kill the <font color=LEVEL>Spiteful Soul Leader</font>, you can get the <font color=LEVEL>Spiteful Soul Energy</font>. Note that a broken one is no use at all... So you've got to bring a energy stone that is in good condition. We'll need<font color=LEVEL> ten </font> energy stones. OK, please do your best... alright?<font color=LEVEL> Oh wait... the coins...?
