Go to the stronghold of Daimon the White-Eyed, find the altar used to make sacrifices and place the summoning orb upon it.<br1>
One more thing!<br1>
Occasionally, Daimon hides the altar. If this happens, wait until the altar reappears before taking action. Apply all your courage and faith to destroying Daimon!
