<html><body>Merchant of Mammon:<br1>
Was it you who summoned me from the Necropolis? Then you must have Shunaiman's contract in your possession....<br1>
We inked our names in that document 1500 years ago, but still the paper bears our names, and still we are bound to honor the terms set out in it.<br1>
I assume you have summoned me so that the clause can finnaly be honored?<br1>
