Thank you!<br1>
Listen closely as I tell you what you need to do. <font color=LEVEL>Lilith</font> has blocked access to the Seal by <font color=LEVEL>summoning a fire wall</font>, but the fires can be extinguished by this <font color=LEVEL>holy water</font>.<br1>
Once that has been done, there's a <font color=LEVEL>red door</font> that you'll need to go through.<br1>
