Ah, you are the adventurer who wants to meet Shadow Fox!<br1>
I know your reasons already, so there's no need to justify yourself to me.<br1>
You want to know the status of our search for the angel, don't you?<br1>
I heard news from Kluck, you know.<br1>But you must be a high-level agent to meet Shadow Fox.<br1>
Before I can fully trust you, I must ask that you carry out another mission for me.<br1>
Are you ready?<br1>
