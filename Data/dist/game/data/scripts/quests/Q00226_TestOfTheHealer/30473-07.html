I don't like the way this is looking. I must send a guard to protect the child immediately.  And I must report this to the High Priest at once!<br1>
Master Sorius has told me of your great contribution to this effort. He was very complimentary of your skills.<br1>
There may come a day when I shall need your help again... I hope you keep your skills sharp for that day.<br1>
Hmmmm, what is that you're holding in your hands...It looks familiar... It reminds me of something that was lost from the church recently. Do you mind if I have a look at it?<br1>
