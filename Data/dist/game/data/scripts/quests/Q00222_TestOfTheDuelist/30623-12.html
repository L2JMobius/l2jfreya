Last of all you must visit the territory of <font color=LEVEL>Aden</font>... This territory is under martial law and many areas are off limits...<br1>
In the southern region of Aden, you will find the <font color=LEVEL>Tamlin Orcs</font>. Defeat them and the <font color=LEVEL>Tamlin Orc Archers</font>. Bring back 10 Tamlin Orc rings and 10 Tamlin Orc arrows.<br1>
Do you remember your mission in each territory? Always remember this motto: "I shall not surrender, I shall be victorious..."  One day the Mark will be yours.<br1>
