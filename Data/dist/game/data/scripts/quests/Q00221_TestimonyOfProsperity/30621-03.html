Well, actually, decoding of the Giant's characters is only allowed by the Elders of the guild. They keep all the knowledge from Giant records for themselves. I will probably not be suspected of breaking this rule since I secretly taught myself. It is an unfair rule anyway. I don't know what they are thinking...<br1>
Anyway, as soon as I saw the stone, I knew that <font color=LEVEL>Maphr's Tablet Fragments</font> were hidden inside the box. Suddenly I heard roars from the creatures all over the tower. I had to run away immediately. As I said earlier, I am not much of a fighter, so if I was attacked by the creatures I would most likely be killed.<br1>
It has been a week since that day, and still I cannot bring myself to enter the tower. But I have an idea... I know where the box is and have determined that a <font color=LEVEL>special key</font> must be used to open it. I have researched the materials and methods of creating such a key, and am quite sure I can do it!<br1>
