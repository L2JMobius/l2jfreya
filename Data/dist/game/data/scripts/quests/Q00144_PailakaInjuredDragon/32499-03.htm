It is a darkness wothout shape or substance.<br1>
It came from across the sea, and now spreads its black shadow over our land as well.<br1>
The Humans call the source of the darkness "Kamaloka" and shadow it casts "Pailaka." Now even our great protector is helpess before it!<br1>
We must summon all our strength to defeat the darkness!<br1>
