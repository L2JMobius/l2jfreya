The enemy are Varka Silenos soldiers. Their camps are positioned to prevent access to the dragon. It will be impossible to sneak past them.<br1>
By facing and defeating them, however, you can obtain a scroll needed to enchance the Spear of Silenos.<br1>
They and only then will you ready to face Latana, the Dragon of Fire!
