Did you recover my medals? Then let's play bingo! <br1>
According to rules of the game, you can <font color=LEVEL>bet either 10 or 100 medals.</font> Of course, betting 100 gives you a better chance of winning.<br1>
<font color=LEVEL>Before we start, make sure you have enough space in your inventory -- if you win, you want to be able to collect your winnings, right?</font><br1>
