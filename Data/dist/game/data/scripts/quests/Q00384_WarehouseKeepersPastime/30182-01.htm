<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br1>
Don't tell my boss, but this job can get kinda slow. That's why we <font color=LEVEL>warehouse keepers created our own fun.</font> I often play  <font color=LEVEL>bingo</font> with the other warehouse keepers. Sometime I even go over to another town's warehouse to play bingo on my days off.<br1>
But to be honest, regular bingo has gotten a little boring for me.<br1>
