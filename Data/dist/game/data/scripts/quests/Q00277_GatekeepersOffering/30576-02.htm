<html><body>Gatekeeper Tamil:<br1>
The magic power I learned from the Ivory Tower of Oren allows me to control the door of space time. It is almost miraculous, being able to reach a town on the other side of the continent with only a few steps.<br1>
But I am ashamed to admit that my understanding of Human magic is incomplete, and I cannot control the door of space time with my powers alone. I need the power of the <font color=LEVEL>totem spirit of the spider</font> in order to use my teleport spell. The spider web spun by the totem spirit of the spider reaches all corners of the universe. Following the spider web lets anyone move to anywhere on the continent in a matter of seconds.<br1>
But to receive the aid of the totem spirit of the spider, I must make periodic offerings. So every week, I offer the totem spirit <font color=LEVEL>Starstones</font>, which entrap the powers of the stars. However, as long as I hold the position of Gatekeeper here, I cannot leave my post. I need someone's help to find Starstones to offer the spider.<br1>
