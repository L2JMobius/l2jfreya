So, this is the report on the findings about the bezoar! Good job. I mean it! It must not have been easy to get information from that hard-to-please Viktor. How is he doing? Dufner, me and Viktor used to hang around together way back when. That brings back memories... Are his explanations still so hard to understand? Anyway, I shall have to look into the results.<br1>
Let me see... My bad premonitions are always right in these cases. I had hoped that this time I was wrong... Damn it! This can't be!<br1>
