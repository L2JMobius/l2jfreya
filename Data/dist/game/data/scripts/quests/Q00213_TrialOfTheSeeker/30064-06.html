You must heed my every word. We each have our own tasks to do. While I am away you must investigate the mutations one at a time.<br1>
They are <font color=LEVEL>Ol Mahum Captain</font>, <font color=LEVEL>Turek Orc Warlord</font>, <font color=LEVEL>Ant Captain</font>, and <font color=LEVEL>Turak Bugbear Warrior</font>... That's it. I expect that they each have a bezoar planted in their bodies.<br1>
The problem is that these creatures are all very aggressive, even more so than normal.<br1>
But I think you can handle it... Do you need any more information?<br1>
