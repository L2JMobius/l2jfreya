Since time is of the essence we must attack them systematically. Now listen carefully!<br1>
The Ol Mahum Captain can be found <font color=LEVEL>near the Fortress of Resistance</font> in the northeast.<br1>
Next you must go to Gludio, which is quite a distance away. I guess it is becoming obvious that these mutations happened simultaneously in several places around the world.<br1>
You can find the Turek Orc Warlord at the <font color=LEVEL>Orc Barracks</font> in the northern part of Gludio.<br1>
You can find the Ant Captain in the <font color=LEVEL>Wastelands</font> of Gludio. Try the underground <font color=LEVEL>Ant's Nest</font>. You should not attempt this one alone...<br1>
And last, the most dangerous of them all... Have you ever seen the so-called Turak bugbears wandering about <font color=LEVEL>Gorgon Flower Garden in Giran</font>? Turak bugbear Warriors are their leaders.<br1>
Now then, let's get busy. You start your task and I shall follow you soon thereafter.
