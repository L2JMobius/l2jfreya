<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br1>
You are indeed an Orc... So straightforward... That's right, I have the remains of Braki.<br1>
I am sure that you will attempt to take it from me anyway if I resist giving it to you. I am well aware of the Oak's great power and their devotion to their hero.<br1>
To tell you the truth, I don't want to fight you. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but if we fight, you will most likely be killed. If possible we should avoid a fight that could be devastating to us both.<br1>
As you know, the remains of Braki are filled with strong magic. If you will find me something that has equal power I shall gladly give you your hero's remains. Doesn't that seem fair?<br1>
