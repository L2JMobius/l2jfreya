Snow:<br1>
Event Chest's are spawned at Fantasy Isle main square<br1>
But they are not 'normal' chests. They are invisible...<br1>
So... you must use magic to see that chests<br1>
While you are transformed into Rabbit use <font color=LEVEL>Magic Eye</font> skill to see if near you are some chests.<br1>
If you see it, target it and use <font color=LEVEL>Rabbit Tornado</font> skill to get reward.<br1>
