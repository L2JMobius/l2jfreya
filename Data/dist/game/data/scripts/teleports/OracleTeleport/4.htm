<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br1>
You have a dimension fragment, don't you? Well, that's not the only thing you're going to need! The space warp is completely unpredictable! If you expect to defeat the devils, you'll have to release your preconceptions of what time and space are!<br1>
I'll try to make this as simple as I can... Will you fight as hard as you can against those damn invading devils that are slipping through the dimension gap? If you are truly resolved to this battle, I'll let you enter immediately! But remember! If you break the Contract without my prior consent, I can keep you from ever leaving the dimension gap! If you intend to quit, you'd better speak up now! Got it?<br1>
Now, tell me! Will you help?<br1>
