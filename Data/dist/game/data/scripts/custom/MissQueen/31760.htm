<html><body>Adventurers' Guide Miss Queen:<br1>
Welcome! I've been dispatched from the Adventurer's Guild to guide characters new to the world of Lineage II.<br1>
In celebration of the arrival of a new era, the guild has temporarily opened its weapons warehouse to adventurers in training and travelers that have reached level 6 and completed their first occupation change. If you meet these requirements, I'll give you a <font color=LEVEL>weapon exchange coupon</font> and permit you to <font color=LEVEL>rent the weapon of your choice from the Adventurer's Guild weapons warehouse</font>. Bear in mind, this coupon is only valid until you reach level 25. Are you ready to choose your weapon?<br1>
(Any character with a PK count of 1 or above is not eligible to receive the coupon.)<br1>
