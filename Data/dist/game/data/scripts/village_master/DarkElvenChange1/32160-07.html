<html><body>Grand Magister Devon:<br1>
The<font color=LEVEL> iron heart</font> is only given to those who pass the Test of the Assassin.<font color=LEVEL> Triskel</font> is in charge of that test. He is a great Dark Elf, who has been an Assassin himself for a long time. He is always near the Dark Elven guild in the<font color=LEVEL> town of Gludio</font>, so you will easily find him once you get there. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road to the east. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is much easier.<br1>
