To become an Scavenger, you must have reached at least level 20 and have passed the Test of the Scavenger.<br1>
There is one more requirement, however. Only those who have experienced the great Human world beyond the Spine Mountains are qualified to change profession. Then and only then will we entrust you with such rarefied skill and knowledge.<br1>
First, take the Test of the Scavenger from <font color=LEVEL>Collector Pippi</font> of the Bronze Key Guild over there. She will tell you everything you need to know. If you succeed, then travel to the Human <font color=LEVEL>village called Gludin</font> and seek out <font color=LEVEL>Warehouse Chief Moke</font>. If he deems you ready, he will change your class to Scavenger. Good luck!<br1>
