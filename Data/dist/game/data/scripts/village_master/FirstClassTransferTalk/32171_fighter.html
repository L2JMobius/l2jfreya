<html><body>Warehouse Chief Hoffa:<br1>
A class transfer occurs when someone with the necessary abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. No Warehouse Chief or Head Blacksmith on this island can complete the transfer, but I can give you the information you'll need. If you are a Dwarven Fighter, you can transfer to a <font color=LEVEL>Scavenger</font> or an <font color=LEVEL>Artisan</font>. Which one would you like to know more about?<br1>
