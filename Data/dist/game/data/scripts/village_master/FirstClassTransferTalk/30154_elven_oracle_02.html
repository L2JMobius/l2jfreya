Anyone wishing to become an Elven Oracle must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br1>
Furthermore, no character may transfer classes who hasn't gained a broader understanding of the world by leaving the forest.<br1>
Follow the road south of the Elven Forest across the Neutral Zone. When you reach the village where you need to cross a bridge, that's the Town of Gludio. Speak with <font color=LEVEL>High Priest Raymond</font> at the Temple there. He'll help you transfer class.<br1>
