A class transfer occurs when someone with the necessary abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. Unfortunately, you cannot complete the class transfer here. I can, however, give you some information about how to do so. If you are an Orc Fighter, you can transfer to an <font color=LEVEL>Orc Raider</font> or an <font color=LEVEL>Orc Monk</font>. Which would you like to know more about?<br1>
