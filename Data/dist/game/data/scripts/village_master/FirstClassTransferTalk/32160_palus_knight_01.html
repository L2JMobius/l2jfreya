The <font color=LEVEL>Palus Knights</font> are the best knights of our clan: fast and deadly accurate in attack and stolidly effective in defense. They are well-rounded warriors, unlike many in this age.<br1>
The most exceptional among the Palus Knights may go on to be selected as a <font color=LEVEL>Shillien Knight</font>, renowned as the personal guard of Shilen, or a <font color=LEVEL>Blade Dancer</font>, whose twin swords weave a whirlwind dance of destruction.<br1>
