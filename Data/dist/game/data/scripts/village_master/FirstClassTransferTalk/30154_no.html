<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br1>
I am Asterios, the chosen representative of Eva, the mother of all forests and nymphs. Of the twelve chosen hierarchs, I am the only one who remains in this land, ruling over the Elves of light in the place of our ultimate sovereign, Valderan. I do not hold speech with those of your race. Please leave this place as quickly as possible.<br1>
