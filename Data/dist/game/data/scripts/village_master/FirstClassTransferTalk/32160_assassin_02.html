<html><body>Grand Magister Devon:<br1>
To meet the qualifications for an Assassin, you must have at least achieved level 20 and passed the Assassin test.<br1>
After passing it, you must return to the mainland -- that is where the true test of your ability lies.<br1>
If you wish to transfer your class, go to Gludio and find an appropriate Grand Master in the Dark Elf Guild willing to train you.<br1>
