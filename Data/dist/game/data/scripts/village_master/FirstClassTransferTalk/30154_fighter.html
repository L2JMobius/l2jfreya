A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. I'm afraid you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. If you are an Elven Fighter, you can change profession to become an <font color=LEVEL>Elven Knight</font> or an <font color=LEVEL>Elven Scout</font>. Which profession do you want to learn about?<br1>
