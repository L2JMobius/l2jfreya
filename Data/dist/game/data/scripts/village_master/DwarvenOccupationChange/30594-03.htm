To qualify to become a Scavenger, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Scavenger.<br1>
Ask<font color=LEVEL> Collector Pippi of the Dwarven village</font> about the Test of the Scavenger. She will tell you everything you need to know about the test, in detail. After you have passed the test, come to me. Then I will change your profession to a Scavenger.<br1>
Use a Gatekeeper to get to the Dwarven village.<br1>
