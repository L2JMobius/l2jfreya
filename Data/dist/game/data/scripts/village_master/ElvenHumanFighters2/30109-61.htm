To be a Plainswalker, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br1>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation to a Plainswalker.
