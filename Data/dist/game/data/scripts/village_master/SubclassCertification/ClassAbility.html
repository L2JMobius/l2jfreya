<html><body>Subclass Skill Certification:<br1>
You are trying to obtain level 75 certification of %class%, common skill or special skill. Remember that once this subclass is certified, it cannot be re-certified -- even if you delete this class and develop another one -- without a special and expensive cancellation process.<br1>
Do you still want to be certified?<br1>
