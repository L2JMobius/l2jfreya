Bernarde:<br1>
He must be from our island -- he has a robust complexion that I haven't seen anywhere else! Rumor has it that the Demons are invading the natives' 
village and laying it to waste. They even seem to have plundered those treasures that the natives cherish most. I would be most grateful if you could 
secure those treasures and bring them to me. Of course, I must also ask you to finish the work being done at the Ancient Temple Remnants.<br1>
