Jude:<br1>
I hear that the Natives' village is often attacked these days. I don't know how the Natives gathered all those treasures and hid them, 
but that's what the Keltas are after. Do me a favor and bring me that treasure before it's all plundered. The compensation will be more than adequate, 
I promise you. Bring me 40 Native Treasures as fast as you can.<br1>
