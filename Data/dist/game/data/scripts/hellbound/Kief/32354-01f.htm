Thanks to your help, the resistance is steadily gaining ground. Thank you!<br1>
I must tell you one more thing, however. Though their numbers have been greatly decreased, the monsters created by Beleth's magic still roam the 
Battered Lands. If you use a special item when those creatures are on the brink of death, you can obtain their life force, 
which contains that primal magic power. This Magic Bottle is the item you need.<br1>
