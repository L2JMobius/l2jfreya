Old Dwarven Ghost:<br1>
Thank the gods... Finally someone willing to help me...<br1>
I will send you...up the stairs of this tower... That is all I can do for now...<br1>
You will encounter powerful devils...who will try your strength...<br1>But unintentionally... some of the devils...may be of help to you...<br1>
Watch out... and increase your strength...in order to survive in this tower...<br1>
